            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT REVEREND Father in GOD, JONATHAN Lord Biſhop of
<hi>Exeter.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am very ſenſible how Criminal it is for any Chriſtian to
do what the very Heathen have forbid, to ſpeak any thing of the Dead, but
what is well; and yet there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill things recorded of Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> in the following Treatiſe, that I might juſtly incur your
Lordſhips diſpleaſure, if I could not plead very neceſſary and
ſatisfactory Reaſons for this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:65960:3"/>Firſt therefore, I plead that I have ſaid
little or nothing in what is now publiſhed, but what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of himſelf, as Matters of Fact in the Hiſtory of his Life, and
other Books printed in his Life time, or what is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred from the
ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Subſtance of what is now publiſhed, was
printed about nine years before his Death, which it is evident he had
peruſed, and acknowledgeth he had given no Anſwer to it, (except a
<hi>Menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> which was his uſual Reply to other Adverſaries, for
want of Reaſon and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument).</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſay that (though dead) he hath firſt provoked me;
for in <hi>p.</hi> 188. <hi>part</hi> 3. of his Life, he ſaith, Long
<hi>of</hi> Exeter <hi>wrote ſo fierce a Book to prove me out of my own
Writings to be one of the worſt Men living on Earth (full of Falſhoods and
old retracted Lines and half Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) that I never ſaw any like it:</hi>
and yet though ſo much concerned, and ſurviving about Nine years, he hath
not<pb facs="tcp:65960:3"/>diſcovered that fulneſs of Falſhoods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which he ſuggeſted; but tells his Readers that it is none of the Matter in
Controverſie, whether he be good or bad: whereas it is certain, that a good
Man would never ingage in ſo bad a Cauſe as he hath defended by his
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Actions, as well as in many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and he himſelf tells us,
<hi>That a true Deſcription of Perſons is much of the Life of
Hiſtory,</hi> p. 136. of his Life. <hi>And an evil Tree cannot bring forth
good Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I plead not my own Cauſe, but the Cauſe of the Church
and National Conſtitutions, and in truth of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perſons in the
Nation: for this Hiſtorical Relation of his own Life, contains a virulent
invective and grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Satyr againſt all that live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the
Eccleſiaſtical or Civil Laws; the King is repreſented as a Papiſt and
Authorizer of the Iriſh Inſurrection; the Parliament is Tyrannical, making
ſuch Laws as proved Taring Engines,<pb facs="tcp:65960:4"/>and ſuch as no Man fearing
God could ſubmit to; the eſtabliſhed Order of Epiſcopacy as
Antichriſtian; the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as perjured and perſecuting Perſons; the
Nobility and Gentry as ſtrengthners of Iniquity in the Land: And do not
ſuch Scandals demand a Reply?</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is neceſſary to diſperſe thoſe Clouds and
Umbrages with which he would cover his miſchievous Deſigns, his Pleas for
Peace, firſt, ſecond, and third, and his <hi>Only way of Concord,</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing elſe but Seeds of Diſcord and Confuſion; and neceſſary
it was that ſuch ill things ſhould have good Names given them: thoſe that
would propagate Schiſms and Hereſies need a Form of Godlineſs to ſet
them off. <hi>Arius, Aerius,</hi> and <hi>Donatus</hi> were Men of good
Learning, and as to appearance of good Lives alſo; yet the one moſt
ſtrangely propagated that damnable Error of <hi>denying the Lord that bought
him:</hi> and the other thoſe Schiſms which have divided the Body of
Chriſt, his<pb facs="tcp:65960:4"/>Church, to this preſent Age: 'Tis but an Artifice
therefore of all Seducers, of which the Apoſtle forewarns us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3.2,3. <hi>That in the laſt days men ſhould be lovers of themſelves,
covetous, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy, without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection; truce-breakers, falſe
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good,
traitors, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, high-minded; lovers of pleaſures more than of God;</hi> and
all this under a Form of Godlineſs; and when even Satan can transform
<hi>himſelf into an Angel of Light,</hi> it is no marvel if his Miniſters
be transformed as the <hi>Miniſters of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. I remember that our Excellent Biſhop of
<hi>Worceſter</hi> prudently foretold of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> That <hi>he
would dye lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his ſting in the wounds of the Church;</hi> which Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly fulfilled in this and many other of his
Writings, which Stings muſt be pluckt out, or the Wounds which they 
<pb facs="tcp:65960:5"/>have made, will be ſtill kept open and bleeding; for though Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> be dead, he hath done what he could to raiſe up, and arm a
Succeſſion of ſuch a Generation of Diſſenters, as ſhall ſtill eat
into the Bowels of the Church, and he hath provided a Magazine of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
for them. Mr. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> tells us, How much <hi>he was delighted in a
hopeful Race of young Miniſters and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; how much he valued young
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and hopeful Candidates for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; how liberal he was of
Counſel and Encouragement to them, and inquiſitive after, and pleaſed
with their growthful Numbers and Improvement.</hi> (And he told me) <hi>that he
had the greateſt hopes and expectations from the ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of
them, that they would do God's Work much better than we had done before
them.</hi> To which end he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, in the beginning of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
<hi>That Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>left the orderly diſpoſal of his bequeathed
Library to young poor Students.</hi> So that here is a Fund<pb facs="tcp:65960:5"/>provided
for a perpetual Schiſm. And Mr. <hi>Sylveſter</hi> hath diſcovered a
hidden Treaſure of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, which he is improving as a Supply
of Deficiencies, in another Volume.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewn your Lordſhip the Reaſons of my Undertaking, I
ſhall briefly give you an Account of what I have performed to fruſtrate
theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Attempts. Your Lordſhip knows, I have ſerved as a
Veterane Souldier in theſe Parts of the Church Militant about Fifty years,
and might now ſue for a Diſmiſſion (being ſomewhat elder than Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> was when he left writing, which was, as Mr.
<hi>Sylveſter</hi> ſays, <hi>Seven years before his death,</hi> when he
was, as I compute it, Sixty nine years old, and I am now entred into the
Seventy ſixth year) yet to excite and encourage men of greater Abilities, I
have, as I were able, performed theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whereas a great part of this, and other
Writings of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as alſo of his whole Life, hath been ſpent
<pb facs="tcp:65960:6"/>in framing Objections againſt, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations of our
well-eſtabliſh'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Liturgy, which he blameth as too
confuſed for want of Method; and for its Matter (abſtracted from the Penal
Laws) as abounding with Thirty or Forty ſuch tremendous things as a man
fearing God could not comply with; though many men, ſuch as Dr.
<hi>Beveredge, Comber, Falkner,</hi> and the Authors of the <hi>London</hi>
Caſes, have convincingly Anſwered and Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; yet conceiving that
none could ſo effectually confute them (<hi>ad homines</hi> at leaſt) as
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath done, I recommended them that are
unſatisfied, to the ſerious uſe of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Laſt
Legacy and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions to Diſſenters,</hi> lately printed, which if they
would read without prejudice and malice, well weigh the force of his Arguments,
they would do much right to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: For whoever
ſhall think of oppoſing what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſaid in<pb facs="tcp:65960:6"/>Paſſion or heat of Diſputation againſt what is propoſed in
thoſe Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will but ſhew how often Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath
contradicted himſelf; nor will any ſober Perſon, that hath ſound and
wholſome Reaſons offered by <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> for the informing of his
Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſcience, paſs by thoſe and faſten on ſuch putrified
Soars and Ulcers, and like the Horſe-leach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſucking in Corruption
till he burſts and dyes, when Salutary Food is provided.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his
Admirers value him for his great Zeal and conſtant Endeavours for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Charity, and particularly for Unity, Love, and Concord between all Parties in
this Nation, I have ſhewn in this Abridgment of his Life, and moſtly
<hi>(ex Ore ſuo)</hi> from his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that as much as in him lay, he
hath made the Terms of Love and Union impoſſible; and that as he was a
great Incendiary of our Unnatural<pb facs="tcp:65960:7"/>Wars from the beginning to the
end, having engaged ſome Thouſands in the Rebellion, and ſerved as a
Chaplain to the Garriſon at <hi>Coventry</hi> in 1642. ſo he was a Chaplain
to <hi>Whaley</hi> the King's Jaylor in 1647. ſo in our unchriſtian
Diviſions, he hath been the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Agent and Diſputant (<hi>Quorum
pars magna fuit,</hi> as teſtifieth Mr. <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi>) and that
elaborate Hiſtory of Biſhops and Councils which he began to meditate in the
Year 1640. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many years was printed, to ſhew (as the Learned Dr.
<hi>Maurice</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) how much he wanted of being a Scholar or a
Chriſtian. For Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf was afraid, leſt <hi>that
Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, as opened by him, ſhould prove a Temptation to ſome to contemn
Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, for the ſake and crimes of ſuch a Clergy,</hi>
p. 181. part 3. And indeed they had been intolerable in any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they
had been ſuch as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> repreſents them. But whoever ſhall
conſult the Catalogues of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<pb facs="tcp:65960:7"/>Hereſies, or the Hiſtories
of Schiſms and Eccleſiaſtical Feuds and Tumults, (whether thoſe Sixty
Hereſies reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or thoſe Eighty eight by St.
<hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or thoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Numbers by <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> and
<hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret:</hi> or thoſe Schiſms occaſioned by <hi>Novatus</hi> and
the <hi>Donatiſts</hi>) will have a hard Task to prove any lawful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
to be the Founder of any of thoſe Hereſies or Schiſms. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
therefore, that he hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ruine the Primitive Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
Church, to raiſe a new Model of his own diſturbed Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that if
there be any ſuch Sins as Schiſm and Rebellion, and ſuch as Endeavour to

            <p>Yet leſt it ſhould be thought that I have diſquieted my
ſelf and others in vain, and being an old Man, have dreamt a Dream, and
Combat with Fears and Jealouſies of my own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,<pb facs="tcp:65960:8"/>let it be
conſidered, That as of old a Man of <hi>Gath</hi> came forth, defying the
Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Give me a man that we may fight
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if he kill me we will be your Servants, but if I prevail
againſt him, you ſhall be our Servants;</hi> at whoſe words all
<hi>Iſrael</hi> was diſmayed and greatly afraid, and the
<hi>Philistines</hi> ſhouted and cried <hi>Victoria:</hi> So there hath been
a Defiance publiſhed (in the Life of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) to the whole Hoſt
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereat great Inſultation and Triumph among the
Non-Conformiſts is heard in our Streets; and is there not a Cauſe why an
obſcure Shepherd, how meanly ſoever he be otherwiſe armed, having got
<hi>Goliah</hi>'s own Sword wherewith to fight him, ſhould enter the Liſts
againſt him?</p>

            <p>There is another ſuch Diſeaſe as the <hi>Pice,</hi> that
hath infected both Sexes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and is become Epidemical;<pb facs="tcp:65960:8"/>Mankind ſtill longs for forbidden Fruit, they loath Manna, and

though the Authors are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown, or Perſons of a very ill Character,
who, under the Name of <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> deſign
the Contempt of all Revealed Religion, and to unite us all in Atheiſm. But as
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Perſon was had in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration among many Thouſands of
his Proſelytes, ſo his Remains are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by them as precious and
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, as any Relicks of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the
Superſtitious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Whatever raw and undigeſted Notions, uncharitable

               <pb facs="tcp:65960:9"/>I ſhall trouble your Lordſhip but with one

Firſt for Raiſing that <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, wherein Two hundred

yet the confirming it by two ſuch Evidences as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the

that will be buzzing about my Ears, but I am an old Man and hard of Hearing,
ſo that I ſhall not be troubled with their Noiſe; and as for their
impotent Stings, they have been ſo vainly ſpent on the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> that they are become very Drones. And I well remember, that
when the preſent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> had provoked them by his

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>I Think it reaſonable to give the Reader an Account how I became
obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in this troubleſome Adventure, and for his Satisfaction
and my own Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall declare the firſt occaſion of my
Conteſt with Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> It is generally known how many Books Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> hath written to juſtifie that Separation which he, and others
of his Perſwaſion, had printed, ſome of which he called <hi>elaborate and
unconfutable;</hi> and as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Goliah,</hi> deſpiſed all the
Hoſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoever appeared againſt him, was preſently
born down with ſuch a Flood of Gaul and bitter Language, (whereof he had an
inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible ſtore) that it was enough to affright any conſiderate Man
from approaching near him; he was reſolved to have the laſt word to every
Oppoſer; and his word was as Law and Goſpel to all his Party. Theſe
Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations occaſioned me to think of dealing with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
in ſome other Method; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<pb facs="tcp:65960:12"/>read ſomething, and heard
more of his ingaging in our late War, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued well-nigh from the
beginning to the end about 71 years, and had been preſent at moſt of the
great Fights and Sieges in that war, as you will find hereafter from his own
rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I reſolved to be at ſome pains to trace his progreſs
throughout the War; and becauſe I wanted opportunity to enquire it from
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and partly becauſe I might neither be truly or fully informed,
either from ſome of the Party with whom he was, or the Party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom
he was ingaged, I thought it much more ſafe and unqueſtionable to relate
ſuch of his Actions, and his Principles and Reaſons on which he acted, as I
could glean up from his own undoubted Writings: which being done, though I now
perceive I were in the dark, as to many other conſiderable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
recorded by himſelf in his Life at large, I cauſed my Collections to be
printed in the Year 1682. while Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was living, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he
Reflects as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Long <hi>of Exeter (if Fame miſreport not the
anonimous Author) wrote ſo fierce a Book to prove me out of my own Writings
to be one of the worſt Men living on Earth,</hi> (full of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>fred Lines, and half Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
<hi>that I never ſaw the like of it; and being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed with work, and
weakneſs, and pains, and having leaſt zeal to defend a Perſon ſo bad as
I know my ſelf to be, I yet never anſwered<pb facs="tcp:65960:12"/>him, it being none
of the matter in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, whether I be good or bad? God be merciful to
me a ſinner.</hi> P. 188. of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will not gainſay his Conjecture of the Author
of the Book in queſtion, which was intituled <hi>The ſecond Part of the
unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Separation,</hi> which was printed 1682. The Book
could not ſeem to be ſo fierce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account of his own Relations
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Actions and Writings, which if they repreſent him to be one
of the worſt Men living upon Earth, I could not help that. Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf, in his <hi>Hiſtory of Biſhops,</hi> pleads for
his juſtification, <hi>That he made uſe of their own words.</hi> In the
Preface to that Book he ſays, (in a Parentheſis) <hi>That the Book was full
of Falſhoods, retracted Lines, and half Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>) but that <hi>he
never anſwer'd it,</hi> which is very ſtrange, ſeeing he lived above 9
years after he had peruſed the Book, in which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval he wrote ſeveral
large Treatiſes, which leſs concerned him than that wherein he ſays he
was ſo much miſ-repreſented: And in all probability, if the Book which he
reflects on, had been ſo <hi>full of Falſhoods, retracted Lines, and half
Sentences,</hi> he might, during that interval, have found leiſure enough to
have given ſome Inſtances of what he pretended againſt, with his Plea of
being <hi>overwhelmed with work, weakneſs, and pains,</hi> appears to be but
a vain Excuſe, for he had zeal enough to defend himſelf againſt ſeveral
others, that charged<pb facs="tcp:65960:13"/>him with much leſſer Miſcarriages. And
it was very conſiderable to the Matter in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, whether the
Perſon ſo fiercely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed were good, or bad? whether he were an
honeſt, and peaceable Man? one wholly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerve a private
intereſt againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick welfare? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thought this a
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſo many adhered to the Parliament, <hi>That though the King had
the Cauſe, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had the better Men,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Life, <hi>p.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>For my part, I ſhould have been extreamly confounded, if either
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whilſt he was living, or any one ſince his death,
could have diſcovered an hundredth part of that Fierceneſs, Falſhood, or
imperfect Sentences in my Book, which Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Church Hiſtory of Biſhops,</hi> wherein he
ſtrikes at Chriſtianity it ſelf, by the Reproaches which he caſts on
the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhops, calling them <hi>A few turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> p.
46. <hi>ſilencing and deſtroying Prelates,</hi> p. 73. <hi>proud,
contentious, ambitious, and hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Biſhops,</hi> p. 77. <hi>firebrands
of the world,</hi> p. 98. <hi>mercileſs, furious, and confounders of
Churches,</hi> p. 183. Nor doth he deal more mercifully with our Dioceſan
Biſhops, whom he calls <hi>Silencing damning Prelates, Bryars and Thorns, and
Military Inſtruments of the Devil.</hi> Though in a good mood he ſaith,
<hi>That none of the Biſhops had ſilenced them, unleſs by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as
Peers in the Houſe of Lords for the Laws

yet,</hi> ſays he, <hi>all did<pb facs="tcp:65960:13"/>not.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
ſpares none: nor doth Dr. <hi>Maurice,</hi> in his <hi>Vindication of the
Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church and Dioceſan Epiſcopacy,</hi> in anſwer to Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Church Hiſtory of Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. ſpare him;
for whoever reads the Preface to that Anſwer, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.
<hi>p.</hi> 276. where he abundantly proves Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s ignorance and
ſcandalous imputation of the Hereſies, Schiſms, and Troubles which were
raiſed by ſeveral Presbyters againſt their Orthodox Biſhops to thoſe
Primitive Fathers, he will be of the ſame mind that I am, That there never
was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny School-boy more juſtly, though ſeverely chaſtiſed for any
Fault, than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is for that Treatiſe which he ſays is very
elaborate and unconfuted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in a Preface to his <hi>Penitent
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Sect.</hi> 9. hath this Queſtion and Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould one have the better of any Adverſary
that blamed him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Speak and do things that are moſt odious, as
Perjury, Lying, Perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and cover them with Sacred
Pretences; and then all that accuſe thee will be taken for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Railers.</p>
            <p>This method Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> uſeth for Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his
Adverſaries. Thus he anſwered the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Sermon
againſt Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, calling it <hi>A Schiſmatical Sermon</hi> in his
Preface to his <hi>ſecond Defence,</hi> p. 12, and ſays, That the
Biſhop's Book is made up, 1. <hi>Of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true Accuſations;</hi> 2.
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntrue Hiſtorical Relations;</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:65960:14"/>3. <hi>Fallacious
Reaſonings:</hi> And <hi>that in writing that Book againſt the Biſhop, he
felt ſo little Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he thought verily that he ſinned all the
while for want of a livelier ſence of the ſin and hurt which he was
detecting by his Confutation.</hi> And which is to be noted, in an Epiſtle
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory to the Biſhop, he confeſſeth, <hi>That he anſwered him in a
manner that required his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and if it was too provoking, he beggs his
pardon.</hi> But afterwards adds, <hi>I doubt that I took advantage of his
temerity, and confuted him in too provoking terms; and that ſome meer
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent noiſe was made</hi> (to his Anſwer) <hi>by ſome one that is
confuted.</hi> But the Biſhop ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what kind of Confutation it was,
<hi>p.</hi> 59. of the <hi>Hiſtory of Separation;</hi> Mr. Baxter
<hi>diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much anger and unbecoming Paſſion, that I truly
pitied him; and was ſo far from being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by it, that it was
enough to cure an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Paſſion, to ſee how ill it became a Man of
his Age, Profeſſion, and Reputation; for he ſeems to have written the
whole Book in one continued fit of anger.</hi> For which, and the ſcurrility
of his Preface, wherein having in twenty parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars deſcribed the moſt
unskilful, proud, partial, obſtinate, cruel, and impertinent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
he could think of places of Scripture or Similitudes for; he thus concludes,
<hi>Though all this be not the Caſe of the Reverend Biſhop,</hi> &amp;c.
which the Biſhop notes to be a malicious way of Reproaching, to name ſo
many very ill things, and leave the Reader to apply as<pb facs="tcp:65960:14"/>much as he
pleaſeth. And in <hi>p.</hi> 63. the Biſhop complains that Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>That his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples overthrow all Religion; and
that he was a ſecret <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderminer of the Proofs of a Deity,</hi> p. 63. of
the Biſhop's Preface.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner he confutes Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi>'s
Letter concerning him; ſaying, <hi>It is moſt ſhameleſs for untruths in
publick matters of fact;</hi> and adds (Ironically) <hi>the Accuſer is a
Member of the beſt Church in the World; but is this bundle of his groſs
untruths, a proof that he is one of the best men in the World?</hi> In the like
manner he reflects on Biſhop <hi>Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Debate, That
his Book was ſo diſingenious and virulent, as cauſed most religious
People to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it for the ſtrain, and tendency, and probable effects,</hi>
Baxter's Life, part 2. p. 39. As for Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> he thinks it
Confutation enough of his former and latter Writings, <hi>that they were
virulent and ignorant,</hi> p. 198. of his Life, part 3. But Dr.
<hi>Sherlock</hi>'s <hi>Practical Treatiſes,</hi> whereof we have many, are
as ſound, pious, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I need not ſay as any of Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s, but as any other on ſuch Subjects as he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on;
as of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> &amp;c.
Dr. <hi>Fulwood.</hi> though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had formerly commended him for
a Learned Man; yet for ſome Reflections on his Book called <hi>Sacrilegious
Deſertion,</hi> he calls him <hi>rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruſſian,</hi> p. 6. and his
Reflections are a few confident ſilly Reaſonings: And <hi>p.</hi> 60. tells
him of his <hi>want of common ſence and modeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65960:15"/>P. 113. part 1. of his Life, he ſays, That
<hi>Dr.</hi> Pierce <hi>wrote a bitter Book againſt him, full of malignant
bitterneſs againſt godly men, and breathing out blood-thirſty malice in a
fluent ſtile; abundance of lies are alſo in it againſt the old Puritans
and me.</hi> And that <hi>he wrote a much more railing malicious Volume than
the former, the livelieſt expreſs of Satan's image, malignity, bloody
malice and falſhood, cover'd in handſom railing Rhetorick. I have not
heard,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of three ſuch railing men in</hi> England,
<hi>as</hi> Tyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>junior,</hi> Pierce <hi>and</hi> Gunning; <hi>of the
Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its Opinion in Doctrinals, and of the old Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical complexion; the
ableſt men that their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath in all the Land; of great diligence in
ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and reading; of excellent oratory and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lives: but all their
parts ſo ſharpned with a furious perſecuting Zeal against thoſe that
diſlike Arminianiſm, high Prelacy, or full Conformity, that they are like
Bryars and Thorns, not to be handled but by a fenced hand; breathing out
threatnings againſt God's Servants better than themſelves, and ſeem
unſatisfied with blood and ruins, and ſtill cry, Give, Give; bidding as
loud Defiance to Chriſtian Charity, as every</hi> Arius <hi>or any Heretick
did to Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I fear I have offended my Reader by ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him ſuch
heaps of putrid and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Garbage. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> offering no
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Argument (for how could he againſt his own Relations and
undeniable Matters of Fact, except he had given himſelf the lye) I 
<pb facs="tcp:65960:15"/>thought nothing elſe needful but to ſhew the temper of the
Man, and the uſual manner of his Communication, to convince the Reader that
he too often calls evil good, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and ſupplies the want of
Argument and Reaſon with Invectives and Railing.</p>
            <p>As to his Charge that my Book was full of Falſhood, half
Sentences, none was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, or better able to have ſhewn a few
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, if the Book had been ſo full: And for quoting any retracted
Lines, I never heard much of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Retractations, though he had
reaſon enough to have written as largely upon that Subject as St.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> did. I do not think that his expunging out of his Kalender
of Saints the names of <hi>Brook Pym, White,</hi> &amp;c. amounted to a
Retractation, becauſe he told us that <hi>he did it not as altering his
judgment of them, but becauſe it gave offence.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſhews reaſon enough to have expunged the Lord <hi>Brook;</hi> for
<hi>p.</hi> 63. of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Life, part 1. he ſays, <hi>That the
Lord</hi> Brook <hi>was known, and noted as</hi> a groſs Sectary <hi>in the
Houſe of Peers, and Sir</hi> Henry Vane <hi>in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
As for the retracted Lines in his <hi>Holy Commonwealth,</hi> it is evident
that they alſo gave offence, but that his judgment of them was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
appears not. He ſeemed willing ſometime that ſome of his Maxims in that
Book ſhould be taken as not written: but finding that he hath in other
Writings ſince that, written much to the like purpoſe, I think he continued
to<pb facs="tcp:65960:16"/>be of the ſame mind that <hi>Pilate</hi> was, <hi>Quod

<hi>In</hi> June 1676. <hi>Mr.</hi> Jane <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> London's
<hi>Chaplain, preached to the Lord Mayor, and turned his Sermon against</hi>
Calvin <hi>and me, charging me that I had ſent as bad men to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as
ſome that be in Hell; becauſe I had ſaid in my</hi> Saints Reſt
<hi>of</hi> Brook, Pym, Hampden <hi>and</hi> White, <hi>that I thought of
Heaven with the more pleaſure, becauſe I ſhould meet them there. This
made me blot out thoſe Names after</hi> 1659. <hi>not as changing my mind,
but not to give offence.</hi> For which Reaſon he ſhould have blotted out
thoſe hard Speeches and uncharitable Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which there follow:
<hi>Theſe damning Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts are for our Silencing, Impriſonment, and
Ruine;</hi> and <hi>Factious Damners, that for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment condemn good men,
are ordinarily ſelf-condemned.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s handling my
Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo rudely, makes me leſs concerned at his railing on me.</p>
            <p>And this may ſatisfie the Reader why I took the pains to Review
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Life, as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by himſelf; to enquire what
Diſcovery he had made of Falſhoods, retracted Lines, or half Sentences, of
which I found not any Inſtance, which made me to wonder; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found
in the <hi>Appendix to his Life,</hi> p.108, 109, 110, 111. a large and
ſcandalous Letter directed to me, and dated <hi>July</hi> 26. 1678. wherein
he calls me to an account for<pb facs="tcp:65960:16"/>three Particulars which I had
mentioned in my Examination of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s Treatiſe of
<hi>Schiſm,</hi> in which I repreſented Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as a Perſon
of a peaceable Temper, and made uſe of his Arguments to confute thoſe of
Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> which pleaded for Schiſm, for which he ought (as he
ſeems to do in the beginning of his Letter) to give me thanks; yet he that
reads that angry Letter, may perceive that he ſought occaſions to quarrel
and defame me, when there was no Provocation given him: But when (he ſays) I
repreſented him as the worſt Man on Earth, and that by Falſhoods,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhuns the Occaſion of juſtifying himſelf, or
proving any of his Accuſations againſt me.</p>

            <p>IT is a Caution neceſſary to be obſerved by all

this Prejudice cauſeth men to be <hi>puffed up</hi> one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Teachers, to an oppoſition of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves. This St.
<hi>Jude</hi> obſerves to have been the fault of the Gnoſtick Diſciples,
who <hi>had the Perſons of Seducers in admiration, becauſe of advantage;
(viz.)</hi> the liberty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, and temporal accommodations which were 
<pb facs="tcp:65960:18"/>permitted and promiſed by them. And by ſuch means St.
<hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, that his <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 3.1. were ſo

Prejudices, they have been involved: whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, being

leſs than a Miracle was thought ſufficient. And no other account can be
given, why ſo many Learned Men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do, against
Scripture, Reaſon, and Senſe, believe and defend ſuch great Errours as
they generally do, but the tyranny of Prejudice and Education: for, <hi>quo

            <p>Now ſuppoſe that I had made this Diſcourſe to a Papist,
you cannot but think it reaſonable that<pb facs="tcp:65960:19"/>he ſhould, in a matter
of ſo great concern as his Salvation, make diligent inquiry whether the
Principles in which he hath been inſtructed from his youth, be agreeable to
the Rules of Godlineſs revealed in the Holy Scriptures, and whether he ought
to believe and practiſe all things which the Doctors of that Church require
of him, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the Infallibility and Supremacy of the Pope,
the giving of Divine Worſhip to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Wafers, to Saints and Images;
or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayers to Saints, and for the Dead, and that in an unknown
Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there is as great reaſon for ſuch as have been
educated under erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Parents, or Teachers in Heretical or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Principles, notwithſtanding their too great credulity and fond opinion of the
Perſons and Opinions of their Leaders, to have recourſe to the Word of God,
and ſearch the Scriptures, whether the Dictates that they ſo tenaciouſly
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto, be agreeable to them or not. <hi>Amicus Socrates, Amicus Plato;
ſed magis Amica ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas.</hi> Let the Perſons be never ſo neerly related
to us, and their Opinions never ſo well approved by us, yet if they be
contrary to the revealed Will of God, we ought to reject them. And if this
practice be neceſſary, as to the National Church wherein we are educated,
(every one being bound to <hi>give a reaſon of the Hope that is in him,</hi>
and not to give himſelf up to an implicite Faith, to believe as the Church
doth believe) much more is it our duty in thoſe parts of Religion wherein we
differ from the eſtabliſhed Profeſſion, when<pb facs="tcp:65960:20"/>it is oppugned
by private Perſons, be they Parents or Teachers: for as it is probable that
they may err, ſo it may be juſtly ſuſpected that they do err, when they
lead us into ſuch Opinions and Practices as have been condemned by the
generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from the most primitive and purest times of the
Church; which they that do err from, will most vigorouſly oppoſe, as
knowing that if they ſhould appeal to them, they will most certainly be
condemned by them.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort are the avowed Opinions and Practices of Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> and many other Writers of this Age; and to know well the Authors of
them, will be a means to undeceive us, and ſet us right in our Judgment of
their Writings, who have cauſed the many Controverſies and Confuſions
which have diſturbed the Peace and good Order both of our Church and State.
To which end I did compoſe ſuch a Character of <hi>the Man and his
Communication</hi> with whom I had to do, as he had in ſeveral Treatiſes

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation heard little of Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> until the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the late unnatural War in the Year
1640. when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays he conceived a Prejudice againſt Biſhops,
and from that time meditated on that Hiſtory of Biſhops which was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Anno</hi> 1680. of which Hiſtory Dr. <hi>Maurice</hi> ſays, that it
ſeems to be written to ſhew how much Mr. <hi>B.</hi> wanted of being a
Chriſtian or a Scholar; for therein, through their ſides, he 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65960:22"/>wounds Chriſtianity it ſelf, by imputing all the
Miſchiefs that had troubled the Chriſtian World to that Sacred Order. As he
doth alſo all the Confuſions which for Twenty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether kept the
Nation wallowing in Blood, and the Church rent in pieces by divers Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries,
as by ſo many Evil Spirits, crying, <hi>Down with it even to the ground.</hi>
Yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> confidently aſſerts in ſeveral Papers, <hi>That the
War was begun between the Epiſcopal Parties, the one adhering to
Archbiſhop</hi> Whitgift, <hi>and the other to Biſhop</hi> Laud; <hi>and
that the Parliament, the Army, and Aſſembly, conſiſted generally of
ſuch as were</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>ſuch as had been</hi>)
<hi>Conformiſts.</hi> I ſhall not, to diſprove him, repeat what others
have ſaid, who refer the riſe of it as far back as King <hi>James,</hi> in
whoſe Reign the Parliaments were divided into <hi>Regians</hi> and
<hi>Republicans,</hi> as <hi>Wilſon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; who tells us of many
Diſputes between Prerogative and Priviledge. There was a Party that
perſwaded that King and his Son to a War for recovery of the
<hi>Palatinate;</hi> and having engaged them, denied them the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which was promiſed, intending to work upon their Neceſſities. And where
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parliaments left, that of 1640. begun, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays. But
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> brings the Matter <hi>ab origine, p.</hi> 32. of his Life,
thus: <hi>Our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, in the days of Q.</hi> Mary, <hi>being fled to</hi>
Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>fell into a diviſion, one part were for Dioceſans, the</hi>
Engliſh <hi>Liturgy and Ceremonies,<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65960:22"/>that they might no more
than needed depart from the Papists, nor ſeem unconſtant by departing from
what King</hi> Edward <hi>had done. The other were for</hi> Calvin<hi>'s
Diſcipline and Worſhip, ſetting up Parochial Diſcipline inſtead of
Dioceſan; that Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>did countenance and ſet up the
Dioceſan Party. The other Party,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> elſewhere ſays,
<hi>flew in the Faces of the Biſhops with bitter Revilings.</hi> And he
notes, <hi>That the Biſhops were</hi> Jewel, Pelkington, Grindal, <hi>Men of
great Learning, good Preachers, and of Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Lives; but the Diſciplinarians petitioned against
their Eſtabliſhment till they were by Law ſuppreſſed: but this
lamentable Breach,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>was never healed.</hi>
Here obſerve that the War was not begun by two Epiſcopal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> often affirms; for this was in truth the Origine of that War, All
the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts were againſt the Prelates, <hi>p.</hi> 33. Sometimes he
ſays it was for Reformation, and to recover our Liberties, to relieve the
Country, and to puniſh Delinquents, <hi>p.</hi> 25. of his Life. And then it
was begun by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ſtirring up Apprentices in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to
Petition with them; and that theſe went tumultuouſly to
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome Biſhops, cried out, <hi>No
Biſhops,</hi> p. 26, 27. and crying for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> drove the King
from <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again he ſays, the War was not founded in Theological
Differences, but Law Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Letter to Mr. <hi>Hinckley,</hi> p. 25.
<hi>The firſt<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65960:23"/>open beginning was about the Militia,</hi>
ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And how then did the Biſhops begin it? The Commons
wreſted it from the King, and by one Order after another, ſeized his Forts
and Magazines, the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy: Had any of
the Biſhops a hand in this? They all did, and now do own, That the ſole
command and diſpoſition of it is, and by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> ever
was the undoubted Right of his Majeſty; and that both, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the
Houſes of Parliament, cannot nor ought to pretend to the ſame. They were
ſuch Conformiſts who begun the War, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who taught, <hi>That
the Law that ſaith the King ſhall have the Militia, ſuppoſeth it to be
againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and not against the Commonwealth, nor them that have a part
in the Soveraignty; and to reſist him here, is not to reſiſt Power, but
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation and private Will. And where the Soveraignty is divided into
ſeveral hands, as into King and Parliament, and the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the other
part, they may lawfully defend their own by War, and the Subject lawfully
aſſist them; yea, though the power of the Militia be expreſly given to
the King, unleſs it be alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that it ſhall not be in the
other.</hi> H.C.W. Theſ. 363.</p>
               <p>Another beginning of the War was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with the
<hi>Scots,</hi> then in the Bowels of the Nation, with whom the King was
infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that ſome of the Parliament held Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with. The Earls
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65960:23"/>Bedford, Clare,
Bullingbrook, Mulgrave, Holland,</hi> the Lords <hi>Say</hi> and
<hi>Brook,</hi> and many more, were ſaid to be of this Confederacy,
<hi>p.</hi> 17. of <hi>B</hi>'s Life; with the five Members and
<hi>Kimbolton;</hi> whom the Parliament and City protected from the hands of
Juſtice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and countenanced armed Tumults. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes
an Objection, <hi>p.</hi> 474. of <hi>H.C.W. That Tumult at</hi>
Weſtminſter <hi>drove him</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the King) <hi>away.</hi>
Anſw. <hi>Only by diſpleaſing, not by endangering, or medling with
him:</hi> though the King tells us otherwiſe in his Chapter of
<hi>Tumults,</hi> to which I refer; and obſerve Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Account,
<hi>p.</hi> 19. of his Life, <hi>That too great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Apprentices and
others, emboldned by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Parliament, not fore-knowing what fire the
ſparks of their Temerity would kindle, did too triumphingly and diſorderly
urge the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as they had done the King) crying, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Juſtice:
the King called theſe,</hi> Tumults; <hi>the Parliament called them</hi> City
Petitioners; <hi>which in the end did more than diſpleaſe the King.</hi> So
that his Report of an Epiſcopal War was but a Dream of his own, though he
affirms he was as ſure of it as of any thing that he ſaw: yet elſewhere
he ſays, no Man can tell where, and when, and by whom the War was begun.
<hi>Confeſſions</hi> p. 61.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> knows another ſort of five Members that begun
the War, who were no Epiſcopal Men; I mean the <hi>Smectymnuans,</hi> who
wrote ſo inſolently and pedantickly againſt that<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65960:24"/>meek,
pious, and learned Biſhop <hi>Hall:</hi> And how <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi>
brought a Petition of 15000 <hi>Londonners</hi> againſt Archbiſhops,
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was ſeconded by the like from ſeveral
Counties: And on <hi>March</hi> 10. 1640. a Bill is read in the Houſe
againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, and their Vote in Parliament ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and many of
them ſent to the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> for entring a Proteſt for their
Priviledge. Did any of the Biſhops call in the <hi>Scots?</hi> or promote the
Covenant? or ſit in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? who were choſen to that very end,
that they might ſtir up the People to aſſiſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament againſt
the King. Though all theſe things be left on Record, yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
thinks by his bare Authority to perſwade the preſent and ſucceeding
Generations, that the War was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by Biſhops, and carried on by a
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an Army, and Aſſembly of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts: yet to excuſe the
Presbyterians, he ſays <hi>p.</hi> 26. that the Separatiſts and
Anabaptiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the War.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not ſay that Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> (whom
he ſo frequently commends) had any hand in the beginning of our Wars; nor
will he ever be able to perſwade others, that what he hath written and
publickly delivered, as Matter of Fact, in the beginning of our Troubles, is
falſe. I therefore refer the Reader to that Treatiſe written with his own
hand, <hi>May</hi> 29. 1647. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt given you part of a Speech
delivered by this excellent Prelate in the Houſe of Lords,<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65960:24"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 425. of his <hi>Remains—My Lords, It is a foul and
dangerous Inſolence which is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to you (in the Petitions
againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) but it is but one of an hundred of thoſe which have of
late been done to the Church and Government. The Church of</hi> England, <hi>as
your Lordſhips cannot but know, hath been and is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably infeſted on
both ſides; with Papiſts on one ſide and Schiſmaticks on the other. The
Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist hath of old diſtinguiſhed the Enemies of the Church into</hi>
wild Boars out of the Wood, <hi>and</hi> little Foxes out of Burroughs; <hi>the
one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of goes about to root up the very Foundation of Religion, the other
to crop the Branches, and Bloſſoms, and Cluſters thereof: both of them
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the utter ruine and devaſtation of it. As for the former of them,
I do perceive a great deal of good zeal for the remedy and ſuppreſſion of
them; and I do heartily congratulate it, and bleſs God for it, and beſeech
him to proſper it. But for the other, give me leave to ſay, I do not find
many that are ſenſible of the danger of it, which yet in my apprehenſion
is very great and apparent. Alas, my Lords, I beſeech you to conſider what
it is, that there ſhould be in</hi> London, <hi>and the Suburbs and
Liberties, no fewer than fourſcore Congregations of ſeveral Sectaries, as I
have been credibly informed, inſtructed by Guides fit for them, Coblers,
Taylors, Felt-makers, and ſuch like Traſh; which all are taught to ſpit
in the face of their Mother the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and defile and
revile her Government. From hence<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65960:25"/>have iſſued thoſe
dangerous aſſaults of our Church Governours; from hence that inundation of
baſe and ſcurrilous Libels and Pamphlets wherewith we have been of late
over-born, in which Papiſts and Prelates, like Oxen in a Yoke, are ſtill
match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. O, my Lords, I beſeech you to be ſenſible of this
great indignity; do but look on theſe Reverend Perſons: Do not your
Lordſhips ſee here ſitting on theſe Benches, thoſe that have ſpent
their time, their ſtrength, their bodies and lives, in preaching down and
writing down Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; and which would be ready, if occaſion were offered, to
ſacrifice all their old blood that remains, to the maintenance of that Truth
of God which they have taught and written: And ſhall we be thus
deſpightfully ranged with them whom we do thus profeſſedly oppoſe? But
alas, this is but one of thoſe many ſcandalous Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and
intolerable Affronts that are daily cast upon us. My Lords, if theſe Men may
with freedom and impunity thus beat down Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, it is
to be feared they will not rest there, but will be ready to affront Civil Power
too. Your Lordſhips knows that the</hi> Jack Straws, <hi>and</hi> Cades,

than Nobility; and thoſe of your Lordſhips that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Nothing could be more plain, than that upon the Call of this Parliament,
and before, there was a general Plot and Reſolution of the Faction to alter
the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65960:25"/>of the Church eſpecially. The Parliament
was no ſooner ſate, than many vehement Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were made against the
eſtabliſhed Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and enforcement of extirpation Root and
Branch. It was contrived to draw Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accuſatory from many parts of the
Kingdom against Epiſcopal Government; the Promoters of the Petitions were
entertained with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. The Petitions of the oppoſite Party,
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with many thouſand hands, were ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſregarded.
The Rabble of</hi> London <hi>were ſtirred up to come armed by thouſands to
the Houſes, offering foul Abuſes, crying out,</hi> No Biſhops, no
Biſhops; <hi>and profeſſed they would pull the Biſhops in pieces. The
Houſe of Lords ſent Meſſages to diſperſe them; they hold on. The
Marqueſs of</hi> Hartford <hi>told the Biſhops they were in great danger,
adviſing them to continue in the Houſe that night. Meſſages were ſent
to the Houſe of Commons, but nothing done for their ſecurity. At last the
Earl of</hi> Mancheſter <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the protection of the Archbiſhop
of</hi> York <hi>and his Company; and the rest, by long ſtay and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
paſſages, eſcaped home. This Archbiſhop perſwades the Biſhops to
petition his Majeſty that they might be ſecured in the performance of their
Duties, and to proteſt against ſuch Acts as ſhould be made during their
forced abſence. He drew up the Petition and Proteſtation in our preſence,
avowing it to be legal, just, and agreeable to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proceedings, and got our
Subſcriptions: And whereas this Paper was first to have been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65960:26"/>to his Majesty's Secretary, then to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and
after to the Parliament, by the Lord Keeper; theſe profeſſed they never
peruſed it; and the Lord Keeper, to ingratiate himſelf with the Houſe of
Commons and the Faction, reads it in the Houſe of Lords, aggravates the
matter as highly offenſive, and of dangerous conſequence, and ſo ſends
it to the Houſe of Commons; where</hi> Glyn <hi>cries it up for High
Treaſon, yea, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to the Powder Plot. The Biſhops are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to
the Bar on their knees, charged with High Treaſon, and on</hi> Jan. 30.
<hi>at eight a clock in the Night, in extremity of Frost, voted to the</hi>
Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>The Citizens entertained the News with Bells and Bonfires. While we
were under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the Faction renew the Bill which had been twice
rejected to take away the Biſhops Votes in Parliament, and prevail. Their
greateſt Lawyers were employed to advance our Impeachment to the highest, but
found nothing to faſten on us: One of their Oracles profeſſed they might
as well accuſe us of Adultery as Treaſon. The Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who
first deſired we might be brought to a ſpeedy Trial, ſuffered us to
languiſh: at last, on our Petition we obtain it. Our Impeachments being read,
we plead</hi> Not guilty modo &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ, <hi>and deſired ſpeedy
Trial. A day is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Wild <hi>and</hi> Glyn <hi>aggravate our
pretended Treaſon; which our Counſel being ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we were put
off to another day, which never came. The Circumſtances of that days hearing
were more grievous than the ſubſtance: we were<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65960:27"/>all
thronged ſo miſerably in that ſtrait Room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bar, ſweating,
and ſtrugling with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs Multitude; and when diſmiſſed,
expoſed to a new and greater danger: for in the dark we must back to the</hi>
Tower, <hi>and ſhoot the Bridge with no ſmall peril: There we lye,
expecting new Summons; but the Parliament wave their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Treaſon,
and accuſe us of High Miſdemeanours; and in a Bill preferred againſt us,
deſire our Spiritual Means may be taken away. After ſome Weeks more,
finding the</hi> Tower <hi>to be chargeable, we petition for Liberty on Bail:
the Lords grant it, and we were freed; but the Commons hearing of it,
expoſtulate with the Lords for freeing us without their conſent; ſo we
are remanded to the</hi> Tower. <hi>Having tarried there from</hi>
New-years-eve <hi>till</hi> Whitſontide, <hi>where by turns we preached every
Lord's-day to a great Auditory of Citizens, upon our Petition and</hi>

deſire the Reader to obſerve, whether from the year 1660. to this preſent
time, it hath not been his chief work to pour out the like Contempt, Malice,
and Violence, as was begun in 1640. and as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſays,
<hi>Maledicus à Malefico non diſtat niſi occaſione.</hi> From
theſe Injuries to the Biſhops, they proceeded to abuſe and affront the
King, and force from him his two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Counſellors, whom they by
unparallel'd proceedings cut off as their moſt formidable Enemies. And having
driven the King away by Tumults, they endeavour by Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Declarations and Propoſitions, to make his Return impoſſible. In
<hi>June</hi> 42. the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſends a Petition with Nineteen Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
to his Majeſty; to which he made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious Conceſſions, as he was
ready to do, even to the one half of his Prerogative, to prevent that Deluge of
Blood which he foreſaw would follow on the War. <hi>Out of theſe
Conceſſions,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (and likely he knows by whom)
<hi>there was framed a Catechiſm that would juſtifie the Parliament in all
their proceedings against the King.</hi> Yet many of thoſe Propoſitions
were ſuch, as his Majeſty declared he could neither in Honour nor
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience conſent unto. One was, ſaith the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Martyr in his Chapter
of the Nineteenth Propoſition, <hi>To bind my ſelf to a general and
implicite conſent to whatever they ſhall deſire or propound; which were
as if</hi> Sampſon <hi>ſhould have<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65960:28"/>conſented not only
to bind his own hands, and cut off his hair, but to put out his own eyes, that
the</hi> Philiſtins <hi>might with the more ſafety mock and abuſe him;
which they choſe rather to do than quite to deſtroy him, when he was become
ſo tame an Object and fit Occaſion for their Sport and Scorn.</hi> This
uſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Faction make of all his Majeſty's
Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions.<note place="margin">P. 37. <hi>B</hi>'s Life.</note> 
                  <hi>The

his declaring that the Legiſlative Power was in King, Lords, and Commons, and
that the Government was mixt, and not Arbitrary; but as ſoon as the
Parliament aſſumed it, they exerciſed as Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily as ever Tyrant
did.</hi> But let them take in alſo his Majeſty's Conceſſions at the
<hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> when his Life was in ſuch apparent danger, and make
a ſecond Edition of that Catechiſm: And I ſuppoſe there cannot be a
more full Juſtification of his Majeſty's real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Peace, who
granted ſo much; nor a clearer demonſtration of their intentions for War,
who would accept of nothing leſs than an abſolute Surrender of the whole
Soveraign Power; and having ſeized that, they could not be ſecure without
his Life alſo.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice (there being ſo many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the
riſe of our lare Civil Wars, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>) to
diſprove Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Paradox, <hi>That the War was begun by Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Men;</hi> which the very taking and preſſing<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65960:29"/>of the
Covenant by them that begun the War doth ſo plainly overthrow, that Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>None but young Men and Foreigners will
believe.</hi> Were they Epiſcopals that Voted down Epiſcopacy, before the
War was began, Root and Branch? Or they who petitioned the King at
<hi>York</hi> for aboliſhing Epiſcopacy and Common Prayer? Were the
<hi>Smectymnians</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Men? or the Covenanters? or the
Aſſembly? and Directory-men? Yet theſe begun and continued the War. Let
the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge what Credit is to be given to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in other
Relations, who aſſerts a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Falſhood in a Matter of Fact, as well
known to himſelf, as to every Rational Man in the Nation. For this, and
ſeveral other Reaſons, I am tempted to believe that he was as far from
approving our Epiſcopacy at the time of his Ordination, as at the time of his
Death: For the Biſhop demanded of him theſe two Queſtions; <hi>Will you
maintain and ſet forward, as much as lyeth in you, quietneſs, peace, and
love among all Chriſtian People, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among them that are or ſhall
be committed to your charge.</hi> Anſw. <hi>I will ſo do, the Lord being my
helper.</hi> Again; <hi>Will you reverently obey your Ordinary, and other chief
Miniſters, to whom the Government and Charge is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over you,
following with a glad mind and will their godly Admonitions, and ſubmitting
your ſelf to their godly Judgments?</hi> Anſw. <hi>I will ſo do, the Lord
being my helper.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65960:29"/>he more induſtriouſly
performed theſe Solemn Vows, or perfidiouſly acted againſt them, let the
impartial Reader judge?</p>
               <p>I now apply my ſelf particularly to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Actions in relation to that War. That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath obtained the
Vogue of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous fry of Sectaries, who though they differ among
themſelves in many conſiderable Points, yet agree to own him as their
Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, is no more than what the Anabaptiſts of <hi>Munſter</hi> did for
<hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> or our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Sectaries for
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Hugh Peters.</hi> That he ſtill profeſſed a
great love to Peace, and zeal for Religion, while under a Form of Godlineſs
he helpt to deſtroy the Power of it, his own Actions will evince. It is
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary indeed, that whoever will ſet up for an Arch-Heretick,
Schiſmatick, or Rebel, ſhould, beſides many plauſible Pretences for
Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errours and Grievances in Church and State, have ſome ſtock of
Reputation, as well for Knowledge as Purity, to buoy them up in the Opinion of
the People, who moſtly judge according to appearance. The Devil and his
Inſtruments could never accompliſh their ends of diſturbing
well-eſtabliſhed Churches and Kingdoms, if they did not transform
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Angels of Light; and not only guild over their poiſonous
Pills with a ſhew of Gold, but mix ſome ſavoury Ingredients with them.
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath in like manner written divers Practical Books with
ſpecious<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65960:30"/>Titles, for Peace, Holineſs, and Self-denial:
and happy it had been for himſelf and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he had publiſhed
<hi>them</hi> only; but theſe being laid as Baits in the way of the Vulgar,
to make them ſwallow his <hi>Polemical Writings,</hi> which are but ſo many
Hooks and Snares to draw them in, and retain them in Rebellion and Schiſm;
our Nation would be leſs in danger of new Flames, if they were all
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to aſhes. Neither Men nor Books, nor any thing elſe, is
properly good, but what is ſo <hi>ex cauſis integris.</hi> And when his own
pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice demonſtrates that his Writing for Peace and Unity are but ſo many
Pleas for Schiſm and Diviſion; and like the Egyptian Temples, however
beautiful in the Porches and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, are full of Serpents and Crocodils
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which a multitude of People do adore; they do not only need an
<hi>Index,</hi> but an <hi>Ignis expurgatorius,</hi> to ſecure the People
from them. There needs no other Argument to undeceive the People, as to his
Pretences for Peace and Unity in the Church of God, than his furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acting
in, and arguing for that moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural War againſt the King. And I dare
challenge and Hiſtorian that hath obſerved or read the Tragedies of the
late Times, to ſhew a Parallel in any one Perſon (I ſay, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amongſt the Apoſtate Clergy, but the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the worſt of them) that
may equal Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Who is there among the Living, that entertained
more early Prejudices againſt<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65960:30"/>the Biſhops? that left his
Calling, as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Peace, and entred with the firſt into the War
againſt the King? and for four years ſpace (which was the heat of the War)
was an Agent as well as an Eye-witneſs of moſt of the terrible Battles that
were fought in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Who ever boaſted of drawing ſome
thouſands to that War? Who hath ſaid more to juſtifie not the War only,
but the Death of the Royal Martyr? Who more oppoſed the Return of our
preſent Soveraign? or hath been as active in making the Government
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie? or who hath or can do more than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to renew all
our Troubles and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? So that I could not deviſe a better Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the late Rebellion and Schiſm, than this account of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Actions and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which is an Abſtract of the Riſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of
both; in whom they yet both live, and with whom I wiſh they may both die.</p>
               <p>Had any Man publiſhed the like Paſſages as are here
related upon his own Credit, they would have been thought a Satyrical
Eſſay, or Romantick Fiction; but being the products of his own Hand and
Pen, and the lively Idea of his very Soul and Spirit, it is impoſſible any
Man can repreſent him a more vile Perſon, than he hath done himſelf in
that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>P. 39. of his Third Defence, he ſays, <hi>I was not bred
in</hi> Wales <hi>nor</hi> Ireland, <hi>but in</hi> Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, (leſt men
ſhould ſuſpect he had been a<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65960:31"/>Jeſuite or Tory.)
<hi>In my Childhood I was first bred up under the School and Church-teaching of
eight ſeveral Men, of whom two only preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once a Month, the rest were but
Readers of the Liturgy, and of very ſcandalous Lives.</hi> (In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to
the <hi>Hist. of Epiſc.</hi>) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> began to be a <hi>Cenſor
morum</hi> before he was at the age of Ten; but being now above Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
either Gratitude or Charity ſhould have obliged him to ſpare the Aſhes of
them that had been long dead, and to ſay nothing, or no ill of them: and
probably ſome of them deſerved better things; but <hi>Ingratum ſi
dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> &amp;c. His firſt Maſter, he ſays, was a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der never at
any Univerſity, and preached once a Month: of him (being allied to Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> and becauſe he mended) he ſays no more, but leaves us to
conjecture, by what he ſays of the reſt. <hi>From the Age of Six till Ten,
I had four School-maſters Curates of the place ſucceſſively, that read
Common-Prayer; two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preached, the other two ſeldom; but the two more
learned drank themſelves into beggary, and left us.</hi> The like he ſays
of one Mr. <hi>Yale</hi> B.D. who drank himſelf, Wife, and Children to
ſtark beggary. After the Age of Ten, he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 58. of his late
<hi>Apol.</hi> he came to live at the habitation of his Anceſtors, (but names
not the place:) the Curate there was another of his School-maſters, who, he
ſays, never preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but once in his time, and then he was drunk in the
Pulpit. <hi>After that I fell into the hand of<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65960:31"/>a Teacher
that ſtudied for Preferment, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Puritans</hi> (it ſeems his love
to theſe, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him againſt all good Manners to ſpeak ſo ill
of his Maſters:) <hi>at length I was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tuition of a grave and
eminent Man of high eſteem among great Men, who expected ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to have been
a Biſhop. He loved me well, but ſo far fruſtrated my expectation, that in
two years time he neither read to me, nor inſtructed me one hour, but
diſcourſed uſually of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned factious Puritans: in his Study,
which was all my help, I remember not one Greek Book but the Teſtament; nor
one Father but</hi> Auſtin de Civitate Dei; <hi>nor any of the Councils, but
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Engliſh and Neoterick Divines: And he ſtudied little all the year
but Biſhop</hi> Andrew<hi>'s Sermons. Hitherto,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter, I
had no Non-conformiſts Principles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.B.</hi> This
was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> I know not of what Age Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
was then; but at Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen he tells us he had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte againſt
Biſhops as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors (as he had alſo againſt his Maſters for
reviling of Puritans.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pref.</hi> to <hi>Cathol.
Theol.</hi> p. 2.</note>)</p>
               <p>If any ſuſpect that his Father infuſed the Principles of
Non-conformity, he denies that his Father ever ſcrupled any Point of
Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or ſpake againſt it, which is a bare Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; yet he was
reviled by the Drunkards and Rabble by the Name of <hi>Preciſian</hi> and
<hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> as bitterly as any Non-conformiſt now. But whether Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> made his Father a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65960:32"/>or his Father him,
he tells us his Father was twice taken Priſoner; and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
firſt Adventure was, to ſeize the Perſon of a Neighbour, to be an
Exchange for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but <hi>quo warranto</hi> I find not. You ſee how
early Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Spirit was fermented with Principles of Faction and
Sedition. At Fourteen years of Age he Cenſures the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned
Biſhop <hi>Morton: I went my ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at Thirteen or
Fourteen years to the Worthy</hi> (but unworthily dealt with)
<hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> Morton, <hi>with the rest of the School-boys</hi> (for
Confirmation) <hi>without any Certificate, and without any Examination.</hi>
(But I ask Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Did your Maſter, who was alſo a
Miniſter, firſt Examine you and the reſt? And how know you but he
certified your Names to the Biſhop, who all know was a Man of Piety as well
as Learning, though you ſay) <hi>He haſtily ſaid, as he paſſed on,
three or four Lines of a Prayer over us, when I knew not what he ſaid.</hi>
This was Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s fault, not the Biſhop's, no more than that he
conſidered not what he Subſcribed to at his Ordination: But he was an
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> a controler of Biſhops at Fourteen: and at Nineteen
his Palate was ſo vitiated, that he diſtaſted them altogether as
Perſecutors.</p>
               <p>Now of what Univerſity Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was, and where he
got that ſtock of Learning which he hath ſo prodigiouſly ſcattered, to
his own, as well as the Nations great trouble, he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65960:32"/>not, nor can I inform my ſelf. His chief Tutors were thoſe (of
whom <hi>p.</hi> 59. of his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol.</hi>) <hi>Three neighbour Miniſters,
venerable for Age, dying two of them above Eighty, and the third near it, were
my most profitable Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; theſe were very worthy godly Conformiſts,
who kept me from the Principles of Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. One of them was a Learned
great Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Conformity, and my chief Tutor.</hi> But what kind of
Conformiſts they were, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells you in a Parentheſis,
(<hi>Though they had all three much rather been rid of it,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>
of Conformity) <hi>and ſo were before they died.</hi>) They were ſome of
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Paſſive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, who waited an opportunity to
be Active in ruining the Church. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> now bethinks himſelf of
entring on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; and (to remove his Scruples which he had
entertained ſo early againſt Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) his chief Tutor
engaged him to read Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sprint,</hi> Biſhop
<hi>Downam, Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that I was not at all in doubt of the
matter; and with this ſatisfaction I WAS OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAINED, AND DID S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BSCRIBE.</hi>
But I verily believe never made Conſcience of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what he
Subſcribed to; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he had never read any thing on the
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, nor ever read the Book of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor exactly weighed what
he ſubſcribed to, though at that time I ſuppoſe he was about Twenty
four. And whether he was made only Deacon then, as is probable, or was 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65960:33"/>ever ordained Presbyter after, I cannot find. Biſhop
<hi>Morton,</hi> who Ordained him, acted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry regularly; and to what Order Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> was admitted, doth not appear: it was not uſual to grant both
Orders at once, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Perſons that never had been at any
Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity: For Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Penitent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<hi>N.</hi> 8. reckoneth among his Sins his ſtrong inclination to have
ſetled at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, till he had attained ſome Eminency of Learning
and Degrees; and accounts it a great Mercy that he was hindered and ſaved
from that danger and loſs of time. And I ground my Suſpicion on what Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, That he Baptized none in Twenty years, and gave the
Lord's Supper to none in Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, <hi>p.</hi> 62. &amp; 86. of Anſw.
to the Bp. of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> No ſerious Presbyter could think but he
incurred the Wo for not Adminiſtring the Sacraments, as much as for not
Preaching the Goſpel: For at his Ordination he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give faithful
diligence ſo to Miniſter the Doctrine, Sacraments, and Diſcipline of
Chriſt as the Lord commanded, and as this Realm, received the ſame; which
he could not do, who renounced Communion with our Church, and omitted the
Adminiſtration of both Sacraments for Eighteen years. See the Bp. of
<hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Hiſtorical Account of Separation, <hi>p.</hi> 151. His
firſt ſetting up was in another Country, among divers private poor Men that
were very zealous Non-conformiſts: Againſt<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65960:33"/>theſe he
pretends he was a forward Diſputer, and by writing againſt a Miniſter of
theirs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout kneeling at the Sacrament, ſilenced the Opponent: and in his
Diſputations for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, he thought he had ever the better. But theſe
Men brought him to reſolve to read the Writings of both ſides impartially,
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Dr. <hi>Ames</hi>'s <hi>Freſh Suit;</hi> whereupon he ſetled
in the Judgment which he never ſince changed, about Liturgy and Ceremonies. 
<note place="margin">Though he had conceived a Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt
them long before as Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, <hi>viz.</hi> when he was 19 years
old.</note> But ſtill he was abſolutely for Epiſcopacy as it is with us,
till 1640. when the new Canons with the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oath came out; which
was the very thing that occaſioned ſuch Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity as he is guilty
of.</p>
               <p>About this time 1640. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> having no Benefice, as
he tells us, 
<note place="margin">See <hi>pag.</hi> 73. of the Treatiſe of
Epiſc. and <hi>pag.</hi> 60. of his Apol.</note> and perhaps for that
reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others being a reſolved Non-conformiſt, betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to <hi>Bridge-North,</hi> a Town in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> conſiſting of
ſix Pariſhes, moſt of them great ones; which were under an Ordinary and
Court of their own, exempt from the Biſhops Juriſdiction; ſo that he
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed Croſs nor Surplice, (his Subſcription notwithſtanding)
having liberty to forbear them. He had no inclination to a Paſtoral Charge
(<hi>p.</hi> 13. of his Life) Subſcription, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as he made
it, he began to judge<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65960:34"/>unlawful, <hi>p.</hi> 14. and while he
was at <hi>Bridge-North,</hi> he never adminiſtred the Sacrament, nor
Baptized with the Sign of the Croſs, nor wore the Surplice, <hi>ibid. p.</hi>
14. This place he choſe to make the Stage for that Prologue which uſhered
in the following Tragedy. To ingratiate him with the People, there is a Report
ſpread that it rained Manna at his coming thither. From the Oath mentioned in
the Canon, he takes the Plot of his firſt Scene, which was this: <hi>Though
every Miniſter in the Country</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>was for
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as well as himſelf, yet they were ſo ſtartled by the
Oath,</hi> (or rather by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who was reſolved to oppoſe
it) <hi>that a Meeting is appointed about it; for</hi> (N.B.) <hi>the Meeting
was to be on his Lecture-day, and it was his lot to be the Opponent;</hi> which
was too much for one Man, to preach the Lecture and manage the Diſpute, had
not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zealous. Mr. <hi>Baxter, p.</hi> 27. of his
Life, ſays overdoing is undoing. To magnifie that days exploit, he ſays,
<hi>The Defendant was Mr.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Cartwright, <hi>a good Man, and
incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably beyond him in Learning, the Defender of King</hi> Charles <hi>the
First against the Marqueſs of</hi> Worceſter, <hi>and the Author of the
Rabinical Commentary on</hi> Geneſis, <hi>whoſe Papers of
Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſince anſwered.</hi> All theſe
Titles he gives Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> to enhance his own Victory, which he
eaſily obtained: <hi>for though my Objections,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,
were<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65960:34"/>none of the ſtrongest, yet the Miniſters thought
that he failed in anſwering them, ſo that they broke up more dubious;
(i.e.)</hi> more diſſatisfied as to Epiſcopal Government than before. And
thus the Learning and Reputation of Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> were made Trophies
to adorn Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Victory. <hi>The Scotch Covenant</hi> (he
ſays) <hi>was not the first impoſed on us</hi> (that would have been
ſwallow'd without chewing, though impoſed without Authority:) but this,
though required by lawful Authority, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and reſolved to
oppoſe. <hi>P.</hi> 37. of his ſecond Defence againſt the Biſhop of
<hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays he was <hi>ſo well
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted forty years ago with many aged Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist Miniſters as his
familiar Friends, that he knew their minds,</hi> (and probably was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
with them) which was about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the late War, in which he was ſo
active, that he encouraged ſome thouſands, and by the Loyal Party was lookt
on as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Perſon; for he complains that <hi>they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſought his
Life by unjust Accuſations, though God delivered him,</hi> Poſtſcript to
true Cath. <hi>p.</hi> 312. And now if it appear not by his own Narrative of
his Education what put the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Non-conformity into his Head, yet
that which follows will plainly evince what Prejudices againſt Conformity had
poſſeſt him from his youth, as well againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
Royal Martyr, as againſt his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Superiours; to both which,
by many<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65960:35"/>actual Oaths, as well as other <hi>Legal
Oblations,</hi> he was bound to yield obedience, but acted and wrote moſt
violently againſt them. <hi>P.</hi> 84. He boaſteth of his Succeſs in
converting Souls; <hi>Before I entred on the Miniſtry, God bleſſed my
private Conference to the Converſion of ſome. In the beginning of my
Miniſtry I was wont to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them as Jewels, but ſince I could not keep
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny number of them; when</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Inſtructors of
my Youth did labour fifty years together in one place, and could ſcarcely
ſay they had converted one or two of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes.</hi> This is too
uncharitable a Cenſure of Reverend Mens Labours for fifty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Let others judge, whether he thought not too highly of himſelf. He turned
many from the Church to Schiſm and Faction; and incouraged Thouſands, he
ſays, to ingage in the War againſt the King. If his Converts were ſuch,
he had no reaſon to glory in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them.</p>
               <p>His Treatiſe of Dioceſan Biſhops, he ſays, was meditated
in the year 1640. that is, at the ſame time he entred into a War againſt
the King, he broached Faction in the Church. His Pen diſdained to be leſs
active than his Sword. And it is probable his <hi>Church Hiſtory</hi> had its
Conception at the ſame time: for as they were born near together, ſo no
Twins are better like. On theſe, his Meditations have been more or leſs
employed ever ſince. In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Treatiſe almoſt (for he hath written to 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65960:35"/>the number of Eighty) we are told of the Pride,
Oppreſſion and Cruelty of the Biſhops: and in his five Diſputations of
Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we have a Model of this <hi>Babel;</hi> for the erecting of
which, he hath aſſembled all the <hi>Arian</hi> Heretical Authours that he
could hear of, ſuch as <hi>Philoſtorgus, Sondius,</hi> &amp;c. and out of
them he quotes only the worſt things, omitting what is left on Record
concerning the Learning, Piety, Courage, Patience, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and
Condeſcenſions of thoſe Fathers and Martyrs <hi>of whom the world was not
worthy:</hi> he notes only the Calumnies of their Adverſaries, or thoſe
Infirmities which their Zeal for Truth againſt Errour, and their Love of
Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Faction, might diſcover in them. And contrariwiſe,
ſpeaking of their Adverſaries, whether <hi>Arians, Neſtorians,
Donatiſts, Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> &amp;c. he commends them as good and well-meaning
Men, miſtaken only in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſing themſelves, applauding
them for their holy and ſtrict Lives, without any notice of their
<hi>damnable Errours,</hi> though they <hi>denied the Lord that bought
them.</hi> And thus he hath dealt with the Councils and Ancient Fathers, to
whoſe Decrees he imputes all the Troubles which were occaſioned in the
Church by thoſe Hereticks and Schiſmaticks that oppoſed them, not taking
any notice how great a Fence thoſe learned and godly Men were to the Church
of God, as well againſt Heathen as Hereticks, whom they reſiſted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65960:36"/>to Blood. So that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath not reproached
them only, but Chriſtianity it ſelf, and repreſented the Diſcipline and
Authority of the Church, as not to be ſubmitted to, or tolerated in the
World. And this he doth by the whole Order of Church Governours, that he may
make ours the more odious. He ſays, (as in divers places) <hi>p.</hi> 252.
&amp; 253. of <hi>Saints Rest,</hi> That <hi>the first rage of the Prelates in
ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing as learned able Miniſters, and inceſſantly perſecuting as
godly Chriſtians as the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, was</hi> (juſt before the War
begun) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed an hundred fold.</hi> P. 251. <hi>As I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by
ſight and ſenſe, that the extirpation of Piety was the then great
deſign which ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that very many of the most able
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were ſilenced, Lectures and Evening Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on the Lord's-day
ſuppreſſed, Chriſtians im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, diſmembred, and
baniſhed:</hi> (He ſpeaks as if it were done by Heathen, for no other
cauſe but as being Chriſtians:) <hi>That it was as much at least as a mans
Eſtate was worth, to hear a Sermon abroad, when he had none (or worſe) at
home; to meet for Prayer, or any other godly Exerciſe; and that it was a
matter of Credit, and a way to Preferment, to Revile and be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to thoſe
that were most Conſcientious, and every where ſafer to be a Drunkard or an
Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, than a painful Chriſtian; and that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Humane
Ceremonies took place, when the Worſhip of Christ's Inſtitution was cast
out, (beſides the ſlavery that invaded us in Civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.) 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65960:36"/>So I am most certain, that this was the Work which we took
up Arms to reſist; and thoſe were the Offenders whom we endeavour to
offend.</hi> You ſee Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is armed with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Zeal
<hi>Cap-a-peé</hi> for a War, wherein to reſiſt his Superiours,
under a pretence of Reformation, though to that Reſiſtance the Word of God
threatens <hi>Damnation.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 271. ſays, <hi>As I
cannot yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but that we undertook our Defence upon warrantable
grounds, ſo I am most certain, God hath wonderfully appeared through the
whole.</hi> (Succeſs was the great Argument;) of which <hi>p.</hi> 250.
<hi>Having been an Eye-witneſs of a very great part of the eminent
Providences from the first of the War, I have plainly ſeen ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the common Courſe of Nature, in almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Fight that I have beheld. The
War</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>was begun in our Streets, before the
King or Parliament had any Armies, between the Puritans and drunken Rabble that
hated the Parliaments Reformation; and ſo I was forced to be gone before the
Wars. And a Man that was more pious and devout than the Multitude, could not
live by them in most places, but were forced into Garriſons and Arms to
ſave their Lives,</hi> p. 252. of <hi>Saints Rest,</hi> (i.e.) in plain
Engliſh, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> with the other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, put themſelves
into Arms, and ſeized the King's Forts, making them Gariſons againſt the
King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65960:37"/>I deſire the Reader to reflect on this
part of the Narrative. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> often accuſeth the Conforming
Clergy with deliberate Lying and Perjury. What was it in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt the Biſhops at Nineteen, yea againſt Biſhop
<hi>Morton</hi> at Fourteen, being fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with Non-conformiſt Miniſters,
and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Minds, yet to ſubmit to Epiſcopal Ordination, and
Subſcribe and Swear to obey the Biſhop in <hi>licitis &amp;
honeſtis,</hi> and preſently omit the Croſs and Surplice, and diſpute
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly againſt Biſhops, and proſecute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the War againſt the
King, againſt the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and when his taking of
Holy Orders ſeems to be for no other end but to inable him to do the more
miſchief: Was not this to be deliberately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured? But to go on, (he ſays
in cold blood) <hi>His engaging in that War was the greatest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Service
that ever he performed to God: That Neutrality had been ſinful; and to have
been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Parliament in that Cauſe, had been Treachery,</hi> p. 481.
of <hi>H.C.W.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 480. <hi>If I had known that the Parliament
(in that Cauſe) had been the beginners, and in most fault, yet the ruine of
our Truſtees is a puniſhment great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any fault of theirs</hi> (though
it were the cutting off his Head) <hi>against a King can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; and that
their faults cannot diſoblige me from defending the Commonwealth. I knew the
King had all his Power for the Common Good, and none against it; and therefore
that no Cauſe <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65960:37"/>can warrant him to make the Commonwealth
the Party which he ſhall exerciſe Hoſtility against: and that War
againſt the Parliament, eſpecially by ſuch an Army, in ſuch a Cauſe,
is Hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and ſo against the Commonwealth. All this
ſeemed plain to me, and eſpecially when I knew how things went before, who
were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, how they were minded, and what were their purpoſes against
the People.</hi> Would not this Man have made a better Solicitor againſt the
Royal Martyr, than <hi>Cooke</hi> (who ſaid he was <hi>another Solomon for
his parts?</hi>) Did <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> or <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ever object
ſuch things againſt him as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath done? Who could think
that Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who pretends for ſo much Peace, was ever a Man of
ſuch a Temper? With what heart could he be an Eye-witneſs of the Humane
Butcheries that were made in almoſt every Fight from the beginning of the
War? or with what Face could he ſay there appeared more of Chriſt's
Intereſt on the one ſide than on the other, as in the firſt occaſion,
ſo in the Proſecution? <hi>p.</hi> 252. of <hi>Saints Rest.</hi> And again,
<hi>Whatever the end may prove, I am ſure I have ſeen the Lord in the
means,</hi> p. 251. And, <hi>That as we undertook our Defence on war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
grounds, ſo I am most certain God hath wonderfully appeared through the
whole,</hi> ibid. He ſays in the Epiſtle, he was wonderfully reſcued from
many dangers in four years Wars; and after many tedious nights and days, and
many doleful ſights and tidings, he and <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65960:38"/>many of his
<hi>Kederminſters</hi> (whom he, it ſeems, had led on to the War) were
returned in peace; that he was twenty ſeveral times delivered when he was
near to death. <hi>O the ſad and heart-piercing Spectacles,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>p.</hi> 115. <hi>that mine eyes have ſeen in four years ſpace! In this
Fight a Friend fall down by me, from another a precious Chriſtian brought
home wounded or dead,</hi> (precious Chriſtians, no doubt, that died in
ſuch a horrid Rebellion;) <hi>ſcarce a Month, ſcarce a Week, without the
ſight or noiſe of Blood. Surely there is none of this in Heaven; our eyes
ſhall then be filled no more, nor our hearts pierced with ſuch Fights as
at</hi> Worceſter, Edge-hill, Newbury, Nantwich, Montgomery, Horn-Caſtle,
Naſeby, Langport, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (it ſeems he was preſent in theſe
Fights:) For he adds, <hi>Mine eyes ſhall never more behold the Earth
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the Carcaſſes of the ſlain.</hi> And he ſaith, He had
<hi>travelled over the most part of</hi> England (to purſue the War.)</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays the War began firſt in their
Streets at <hi>Kederminſter,</hi> between thoſe that would have pull'd down

were ſo violent againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that he was forc't to fly for his

frighted<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65960:38"/>him from thence to <hi>Coventry;</hi> and as ſoon
as he heard of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he went and
tarried there until <hi>Edge-hill</hi> Fight; and the next Morning hearing that
<hi>Eſſex</hi> won the Field, he went to ſee the Slain, and after that he
took up his quarters at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and ſtaid with the Governour in
his Houſe preaching as Chaplain to the Garriſon for a whole year,
<hi>p.</hi> 43, 44. of his Life. From thence he went to <hi>Wem</hi> in

Forty of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to enter themſelves under Col. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
to ſtrengthen that Garriſon. But <hi>Wem</hi> being taken, he follows the
Parliament Army which marched towards the <hi>West,</hi> where firſt he fully

of <hi>Briſtol</hi> continuing about a Month, he was taken ſick of a Fever
after the three firſt days; but being recovered, he came back to
<hi>Briſtol</hi> Siege three or four days before it was yielded, <hi>p.</hi>
55. He was alſo at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> and went to ſee the Field two days
after the Fight, <hi>p.</hi> 50. He alſo followed the Army that went
Weſtward in purſuit of the Lord <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> and ſays he was three

               <p>Had not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> told us the contrary, we might have
thought he had been born in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and nurſt up by ſome
ravening Wolf, that could ſee the Death of ſo many of his Friends who died
in Rebellion, and were like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh eternally as well as temporally; and
ſo many Loyal Nobles and Gentry periſh in their Integrity, ſome perhaps
by his own hand, but many probably by his procurement, without any regret, and
pleaſe himſelf with the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it; yea, and aſcribe all to the
emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Providences of God, above the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of God's working.
<hi>Matth.</hi> of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> p. 71. of his Hiſtory, That
<hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, in the French Wars, took among other Priſoners
<hi>Richard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Beaux</hi> near his own City, who was
preſented to the King in his Armour as he was taken; and being impriſoned,
the preſent Pope wrote to the King an angry Letter, chiding him for
impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning his dear Son, and requiring him to ſend his dear Son home to
him. The King<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65960:40"/>detains the Biſhop, and ſends only the
Armour in which the Biſhop was taken, willing him to conſider whether that
were his Sons Coat or no.</p>
               <p>Reader, you ſee here a little Man, (<hi>David</hi> ſome
account him) but in the Armour of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah;</hi> and as he, <hi>a Man of War
from his Youth,</hi> defying the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, ſaying,
<hi>Give me a Man that we may fight together:</hi> his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his
Armour, which is all of Braſs, ſo cloſe knit with Lies, Contradictions,
and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that as the Scales of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> you can ſcarce
diſcern any ſpace between them. Let the Reader take a full view of him, and
then tell me whether he be a Child of Peace, or a Man of War. Do theſe things
ſavour of an Evangelical Spirit? or are theſe fit Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for one that
was penning <hi>the Saints E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Rest?</hi> Well may he talk of it:
But ſuch Men as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and <hi>Brook,</hi> (who was actually
ſlain in the Rebellion) <hi>Pym, Hamden,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> &amp;c. who
were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually tormenting themſelves and others in an unnatural and bloody
War, without timely and ſerious Repentance, could never enjoy it; though Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> place them all there, with many more ſuch precious
Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>White,</hi> this Apoſtate Presbyter is another
of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s white Saints, who boaſted that he and his Fellows
had turned out near Eight thouſand Miniſters out of their Freeholds,
contrary to the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65960:40"/>the <hi>Petition of
Right,</hi> and the <hi>Proclamation of</hi> Charles <hi>the First</hi>
againſt the Oppreſſion of the Clergy by the intruſion of Schiſmatical
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into their Cures, mentioned in <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca Regia, p.</hi> 324.
And when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had incouraged the Mob to bring in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles againſt
their Miniſters, he began his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Centuries to blacken the Reputation
of the ejected Miniſters with thoſe falſe Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which their
factious Pariſhioners accuſed them, but never proved againſt them. We
have printed Catalogues of the <hi>London</hi> Clergy, the Heads of Houſes in
both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, as alſo of the Biſhops and Dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> then Ejected as Scandalous and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient. Miniſters
who were Men of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Merit, both for their Lives and Learning; ſuch
as Biſhop <hi>Juxton, Morton, Hall, Coſin, Prideaux, Davenant,
Brownrigg;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sanderſon, Hammond, Holdſworth, Hinchman,
Sheldon, Morley, Gillingham, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Duppa, Howel, Hacket, Weſtfield,
Featly, Walton,</hi> &amp;c. of whom the Age was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, were forced to
forſake their Families and Relations, and to wander up and down, and ſeek
their Bread in unknown Places and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries. Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
approves of theſe barbarous Actions, and takes it for one of the beſt
things they could do to caſt out theſe, and to put in ſuch as he calls
better in their places. See <hi>p.</hi> 78, 79. of his <hi>Apology,</hi> where
he tells us what ſort of Perſons were<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65960:41"/>put into the Cures
of the Ejected Clergy. <hi>In my Opinion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Sequeſtring
Miniſters being moſtly young Men in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, that had nothing
of their own, could not elſe get Bread and Clothing, much leſs Fire and
Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room.</hi> Many of theſe thought it a good work, yea a very good work
to caſt out thoſe as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and Scandalous, and having a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Call to the Work, they thought they had ſo to the Salary. And when theſe
Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were forced by the approach of the King's Army to leave their
Cures to their proper Owners, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks theſe the
Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers before God, and that they were bound, if poſſible, to make
Reſtitution of the Tithes and Maintenance which they had received, as much as
if they had broke mens Houſes, or robbed by the High-way. See Dr.
<hi>Pearce</hi> againſt <hi>Baxter,</hi> § 26.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms, That if Biſhops, who come in by
the King's Nomination, and not by the Majority of the People, ſhall impoſe
inferiour Paſtors on the Pariſh Churches, and command the Peoples
Acceptance and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the People are not bound to accept and obey them as
ſuch, nor is it Schiſm to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, no more than it is Treaſon to
Reject the Uſurper of a Kingdom. So that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pronounceth, as
well the King as the Biſhops, and all Miniſters Preſented by them, or
other Patrons, to be meer Uſurpers. <hi>This is,</hi> as the Biſhop of
<hi>Worceſter</hi> ſays, <hi>an excellent<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65960:41"/>Plea for
Peace,</hi> p. 138, 139. of the Hiſtory of Separation.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit to inform the Reader (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I my ſelf, and
ſome thouſand others, yet live to contradict him) how falſly, as well as
maliciouſly, he calumniates the happy and peaceable Reign of the Royal
Martyr: for ſo it was, until the times of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Reformation. We read, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12. <hi>When the Foundation of the
ſecond Temple was laid, the People ſhouted: but the Prieſts and Levites,
and chief of the Fathers, who were ancient Men, that had ſeen the first
Houſe, wept with a loud voice.</hi> I cannot, without a fit of Grief and
Pain, look back upon thoſe (over-proſperous) times, wherein Peace and Truth
did ſo flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that we were the Envy of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations; and
until groundleſs Fears and Jealouſies diſtracted us, this Nation was as
<hi>Jeruſalem, a City at unity within it ſelf.</hi> Every one <hi>ſate
under his own Vine,</hi> and under God's Vine too. There was no decay of Trade,
no leading to Captivity, till we began to ſurfeit of our Plenty, and to grow
ſick of Peace, and to loath Manna it ſelf; and then God gave us up to the
hands of ſuch Phyſicians as had the skill only to let us Blood, but never
the Art to ſtaunch it, till all our Strength and Beauty, all our Liberties,
Properties, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were paſt recovery by the Wit of Man; and God
himſelf did it by a Miracle from Heaven. And yet this Man of Peace
(forſooth)<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65960:42"/>to whom (and ſuch as he) we owe the loſs of
all our Bleſſings, and all the Damages done to Church and State, is at
every turn defaming thoſe happy Times, complaining of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
Chriſtians, and Slavery in Civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. See what he ſays,
<hi>H.C.W.</hi> p. § 7. <hi>The Peoples Rights were evidently invaded;
many Thouſands have ſuffered, or were forced to remove out of the Land,
upon the account of illegal Impoſitions;</hi> (and though he himſelf
obſerves the contrary, <hi>p.</hi> 88. of his <hi>Apol.</hi>) <hi>Miniſters
were ejected and puniſhed for not bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Altar, for preaching
Lectures, and twice on the Lord's day;</hi> (whereas the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non only required,
that they who uſed that Ceremony, would not deſpiſe them that uſed it
not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> obliging no Man) <hi>and the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Sermon was only
to be exchanged for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techize Lecture.</hi> The Preachers that were
ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced were moſtly <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or
ſuch as were prohibited to preach at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi> One was a Draper,
another a Taylor, a third a Weaver, as appears by the Regiſter there. If any
Miniſters were ſilenced, they were ſuch, as contrary to their
Subſcriptions and Solemn Vows, refuſed Conformity, and preacht up Sedition
and Schiſm, which no Government could endure. Nor were any puniſhed, but
for preaching or practiſing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Faction, which was then ſo
ſtrong as to affront the Laws, and within a little while to deſtroy them
and the Government<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65960:42"/>both in Church and State. To diſmiſs
this Book of the <hi>Saints Rest,</hi> which was his firſt and his beſt, as
he thought himſelf: for <hi>if Mr.</hi> Creſſy (ſaith he) <hi>had read
no better than my Saints Rest, the Life of Faith, the Divine Life, the
Chriſtian Directory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have gone from the
Proteſtants to Popery, for want of an affectionate Spiritual
Devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would willingly prevail with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that as in a
later Edition of his <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> he left out the mention of
<hi>Brook, Pym, Hamden,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as Members of a more knowing,
unerring, well-ordered, right aiming, ſelf-denying, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, honourable,
triumphant Senate;</hi> ſo if he liv'd to ſee another, he would leave out
thoſe unſutable Paſſages which I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and change them for
ſuch as this in the Epiſtle: <hi>I ſhall leave you my best advice for
your immortal Souls, as the Legacy of a dying Man; receive it as from one that
unfeignedly loves you, as if I offered it on my bended knees, yea, as one that
hath received Authority from Christ to command you: I charge you in his Name,
as you will anſwer it when we ſhall meet at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that you faithfully
and conſtantly practiſe theſe Directions,</hi> (whereof this is one:)
<hi>Above all, ſee that you be followers of Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both in the
Church, and among your ſelves. I differ from many in ſeveral things of
conſiderable moment; yet if I ſhould zealouſly preſs my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on
others, ſo as to diſturb the Peace of the Church, and ſeparate from my
Brethren, I ſhould<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65960:43"/>fear lest I ſhould prove a Ferebrand
in Hell, for being a Firebrand in the Church. And for all the interest I have
in your Judgments and Affections, I here charge you, that if God ſhould give
me up to any factious Church-rending courſe, that you forſake me, and
follow me not a ſtep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner had the Preebyterians excluded the Biſhops, and
their Directory the Liturgy, but <hi>the Lord's Prayer</hi> is alſo exploded
as a thing of no uſe, either for matter or form: for the men of that Age
thought it not Spiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for ſuch over-grown Chriſtians as they
were, being adapted only to the Nonage of the firſt Diſciples: Nor was it
ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it, but they poured out all the Contempt they could
upon it, both from their Pulpits and the Preſs. Dr. <hi>O.</hi> was ſo
tranſported with the <hi>In-dwelling of the Spirit,</hi> that at the ſame
time when he wrote againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> he wrote alſo againſt
the uſe of our Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And this Anticriſtian Practice prevailed
ſo far, that the People generally refuſed to teach it their Children: Some
gave God thanks they had forgotten it; and if any ſober Clergy-man did
conclude his own Prayer with it, a great part of his Auditory would preſently
depart out of the Church, as if it were impoſſible for them to be edified
by ſuch a Preacher as had no better Gift of Prayer. And thus to make a
thorough Reformation, they firſt agreed on no more Addreſſes unto God,
before they Voted no more Addreſſes to<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65960:43"/>the King. The
Creed and Commandments ſuffer the ſame Indignities, being generally omitted
in their Publick Worſhip; and in many places, eſpecially at their Lectures,
ſcarce a Chapter of the Holy Scripture read to the People; the whole
Exerciſe being made up of Extemporary Prayer and Preaching: the beſt of
their Sermons, if I may account them ſo that are printed, and were preached
in the greateſt Congregations on moſt Solemn Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, abounding with
ſuch Invectives againſt the King, ſuch Arguments and Motives to
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Shedding of Blood, as will be an indelible Reproach to the
Presbyterian Party, who ſo taught others the Doctrine of Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their
Superiours, that they ſoon felt it to be practiſed againſt themſelves,
who had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down all the Fences of Government, and opened thoſe wide
Breaches by which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hereſies and ſo great Confuſion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
the Nation; ſo that the Pulpit-Drums exceeded thoſe of the Field in doing
Miſchief, drawing on more Souls to Deſtruction than the other did
Bodies.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 43. of his Life, tells us what Chaplains
were in <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army: <hi>Abundance of famous excellent Divines
were Chaplains to his Army,</hi> Stephen Marſhal <hi>and Dr.</hi> Burgeſs
<hi>to</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex<hi>'s Regiments;</hi> Obadiah Sedgwick <hi>to Col.</hi>
Hollis; Calibut Downing <hi>to the Lord</hi> Roberts; John Sedgwick <hi>to the
Earl of</hi> Stamford; <hi>Dr.</hi> Spurſtow <hi>to</hi> Hamden<hi>'s;
Mr.</hi> Perkins <hi>to Col.</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65960:44"/>Goodwin<hi>'s; Mr.</hi>
Moore <hi>to the Lord</hi> Wharton<hi>'s;</hi> Adoniram Bifield <hi>to Sir</hi>
Henry Cholmley<hi>'s; Mr.</hi> Nalton <hi>to Col.</hi> Grantham<hi>'s; Mr.</hi>
Simeon Aſh <hi>to the Lord</hi> Brooks; <hi>Mr.</hi> Morton <hi>of</hi>
New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle <hi>to Sir</hi> Arthur Haſlerigge, <hi>with many more.</hi>
Theſe were the firſt Incendiaries &amp; Boutefew's that firſt kindled and
continued the Wars, and ſuch of the King's Friends as eſcaped the mouth of
the Armies Swords, were ſentenc'd to a worſe Death by the Sword of theſe
Mens mouths.</p>
               <p>In the Year 43. when the Parliaments Army were worſted and
weakned by the King, and they thought themſelves in danger of being overcome,
they intreated help from the <hi>Scots,</hi> who taking advantage of their
ſtraits, brought in the Covenant as the Condition of their help. Thus Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 127. of his <hi>first Plea;</hi> who confeſſeth <hi>it
was contrived as a Stratagem of War to bind the Faction in both Nations in a
Confederacy against the King, and ſtrengthen the War against him;</hi> for
the doing whereof, they <hi>pawned their Souls to each other,</hi> as his
Majeſty obſerves in the Chapter of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And if it be
conſidered by how many Solemn Oaths and Proteſtations the Subjects of both
Nations, as well as by the Laws of God and Nature, were obliged to defend his
Majeſty's Perſon, and the Laws and Government eſtabliſhed; it will
appear to be true, as Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> obſerved, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
Covenant, <hi>That for Matter, Perſons, and other Circumſtances, the like
hath not been in any<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65960:44"/>Age or Oath we read of in Sacred or
Humane Story.</hi> But it did the work for which it was deſigned; it brought
in the <hi>Scots</hi> Armies, by by the promiſed hopes of dividing the Church
Lands upon the Extirpation of Epiſcopacy; and was as fatal to the King as to
the Biſhops: For the King's Forces being broken, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws from
<hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was beſieged, and commits himſelf to the
<hi>Scots</hi> Army, who ſollicite him to take the Covenant, and ſign their
Propoſitions for the Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Henderſon</hi> is ſent
to diſpute the point with the King; and he being baffled, Mr. <hi>Cant,
Blaire,</hi> and <hi>Douglas</hi> endeavoured the ſame; but more by railing
than reaſoning with him. One of them (beſides many rude expreſſions in
his Sermon before the King) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the 52 <hi>Pſalm;</hi> which begins
thus: <hi>Why dost thou, Tyrant, boast abroad, Thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works to
praiſe?</hi> Whereupon the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtood up, and called for the
56 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which begins thus: <hi>Have mercy Lord on me, I pray; For
men would me devour.</hi> Which the People readily ſung, leaving the other.
And the Commiſſioners of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reſolved, That if the
King be excluded from Government in <hi>England</hi> for not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
Propoſitions concerning Religion and the Covenant, it was not lawful for that
Kingdom to aſſiſt him for the Recovery of the Government. Nay, they
threaten to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65960:45"/>ſhortly after they did for 400000<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi>
for the raiſing of which Sum, an Ordinance is paſt for Sale of the
Biſhops Lands at Ten years va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. And by another
Ordinance, <hi>Febr.</hi> 8. none were to bear any Office Civil or Military
that refuſed to take the Covenant. The Parliament having gotten the King in
their power, thought themſelves very ſecure; and therefore reſolves to
disband the whole Army, Horſe and Foot, and to ſend a good part of them for
<hi>Ireland;</hi> which ſo ſtartled the Army, that they began to take new
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. And firſt they demand their Arrears for 56 Weeks. Next, that a
Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Army <hi>March</hi> 13. might be recalled, and they
ſecured for what had been done in the late Wars: which things at a general
Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz they petition the Parliament for; who being under great fears, Vote
all that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. But the Army had a farther deſign, and by 1000
Horſe under Cornet <hi>Joyce,</hi> ſeize the King's Perſon, and detain
him in the power of the Army; which was <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s deſign, who though
he ſate with the Members at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and proteſted there
with Execrations againſt himſelf and his Family, that he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of
the Fact, yet he told his Conſidents, that <hi>having got the King into his
hands, he had the Parliament in his Pocket.</hi> And preſently he falls to
purging of the Houſe, impeaching Eleven of the chief Presbyterians of High
Treaſon, and ſecluded them the Houſe; and <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65960:45"/>afterward
got the Militia of <hi>London</hi> into their hands: for the Army being drawn
up on <hi>Hounſlow-heath,</hi> marched up to the Parliament Houſe, and gave
it a ſecond purge of many more Members; and marching triumphantly through
<hi>London,</hi> did demoliſh their Works; and never left, till he had
ſetled the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his own liking.</p>
               <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Baxter: Four years,</hi> he ſays,
<hi>he was a Member of the Army;</hi> part of which time (by what follows) will
appear to be after that the Independent Party was predominant, and the Army new
modelled; yet he tarried with this Army under <hi>Cromwel,</hi> until the King
was murthered, and till <hi>Richard</hi> the Protector was caſt out of the
Government by thoſe that had placed him in it. Hear what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 14. of his Anſwer to <hi>Bagſhaw: Is it poſſible
for any ſober Chriſtian in the World to take them to be blameleſs, or
theſe to be little ſins? What? the violating of the King's Perſon, and
the Life of ſo good a King, and the Change of the Fundamental Government, and
The Armies Force upon the Parliament; the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a Protector, and
pulling him down again; the ſetting up the Remnant of the Commons, and
preſently pulling them down, to whom</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaid)
<hi>they had ſworn, and ſworn, and ſworn again to be faithful to, and
defend them; and that they were the best Governours in all the World. If all
this was not Rebellion, or Treaſon, or Murder, there is no ſuch Grime
poſſible to be<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65960:46"/>committed?—If I was guilty of
ſuch ſins, I do openly confeſs, that if I lay in Sackcloth, and in Tears,
and did lament my ſins before the World, which had done ſuch unſpeakable
wrong to Christ and to Men, I ſhould do no more than the plain Light of
Nature aſſureth me to be my great and needful duty,</hi> p. 17.</p>
               <p>Now that which Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> accuſed Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> of, was, That he was guilty of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up and fomenting
that War againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had
confeſſed, and that he had drawn ſome Thouſands into it: of this we
have him boaſting often, but not of his Repentance for it. And <hi>N.B.</hi>
he thinks the pulling down of the Protector, and the Remnant of the Commons, to
whom they had often ſworn to be faithful, and defend them, and ſays they
were the beſt Governours in the World, to be as great a Sin as the violating
the King's Perſon and Life, in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pretends he was ſent among the Army by an
Aſſembly of Divines: And I find, that ſuch Divines as attended the
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſſembly were ordered (<hi>Aug.</hi> 28. 1643.) to
go into the Country to ſtir up the People to riſe <hi>for the defence</hi>
(as they call it) <hi>of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> but indeed, to ſtrengthen the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the King: For againſt this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, conſiſting
of half Lay and half Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but wholly of diſaffected Perſons, we find
the King thus declaring by Proclamation: <hi>That<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65960:46"/>many of
them were perſons who had openly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rebellion, and excited the People
to take up Arms against him: That the far greater part of them were Men of no
Reputation or Learning, and eminently diſaffected to the Government of the
Church of</hi> England; <hi>and therefore he forbad their meeting.</hi> But Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgment: he ſays, <hi>I have not read of
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Aſſemblies of worthier Men ſince the Apoſtles days;</hi> Anſw.
to the Biſhop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> p. 84.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter, p.</hi> 73. of his Life, ſays of this
Aſſembly, That <hi>the Divines there congregate were Men of excellent
Learning and Godlineſs, and Miniſterial Abilities and Fidelity; and I
ſpeak it in the Face of Malice and Envy, that as far as I am able to judge,
the Chriſtian World, ſince the days of the Apoſtles, had never a Synod of
more excellent Divines than this Synod and the Synod of</hi> Dort. To theſe
were added ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lords and Commons, and ſix or ſeven Independents, five
proved diſſenting Brethren, <hi>Nye, Goodwin, Burroughs, Simpſon</hi> and
<hi>Bridges, For my part,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, I honour the Men, but am
not of their mind as to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they would have ſet up; and ſome
words in their Catechiſm I could wiſh had been more clear: And above all, I
could wiſh that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and their more skilful hand, had done more
to heal our Breaches. N.B.</hi> The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had a skilful hand, the
Parliament a more skilful; but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was <hi>Magnus Apollo,</hi>
that could have healed all our Breaches, by<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65960:47"/>his only way of
Concord. But which of theſe three Parties were more skilful to divide and
deſtroy, we need a greater Oracle than that of this <hi>Apollo</hi> to
determine.</p>
               <p>I cannot pretend to know much more of the Learning and
Godlineſs of theſe Aſſembly-Divines, than by what I have read in their
Sermons preached upon ſpecial Occaſions: Several of them are named, among
the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains that attended the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Army, Mr.
<hi>Marſhal</hi> was one, who in a Letter of his, <hi>p.</hi> 19. ſays,
<hi>That if the King had been ſlain</hi> (<hi>in the Battel at</hi>
Edge-hill) <hi>it had not been the Parliaments fault, for he might have kept
himſelf farther off if he pleaſed.</hi> And in his Sermon, <hi>January</hi>
8. 1647. <hi>The queſtion is now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whether Christ or
Antichrist ſhall be King.</hi> And in another Sermon to the Mayor and
Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, 1644. ſpeaking of the King's Party, he ſaith, <hi>Theſe are
miſerable and accurſed Men, Factors for Hell, Satan's Boutefews; and as
true Zealots are ſet on fire from Heaven, ſo theſe Mens fire is kindled
from Hell, whether alſo it carrieth them.</hi> And in his Sermon <hi>Curſe
ye Meroz, I pray lock on me as one that comes to beat a Drum in your Ears, to
ſee who will come out to follow the Lamb;</hi> with much more to the like
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>John Goodman,</hi> another of them, ſaith, <hi>That the
Doctrine of Reſiſtance was reſerved for our times.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Arrowſmith,</hi> in a Sermon 1643. <hi>We are not a Kingdom divided
against it ſelf, but one Kingdom against another; that is, the 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65960:47"/>Kingdom of Christ against Antichrist.</hi> So Mr. <hi>John
Bond</hi> told the Parliament, <hi>That they fought against</hi> Babylon,
Dagon, <hi>and Antichrist; and exhorted them to pull it down, though, like</hi>
Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>they died with it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi> in a Sermon 1644.
ſays, <hi>God would have no Mercy ſhewed where the quarrel is against
Religion,</hi> p. 16. <hi>Thoſe who would bring in Idolatry and falſe
Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to depoſe Christ from his Throne, and ſet up Antichrist, Christ
hath doomed to deſtruction. St.</hi> Luke 19.27. <hi>As for theſe mine
Enemies, bring them out and ſlay them before me;</hi> p. 18. Mr. <hi>Thomas
Palmer</hi> ſaid, <hi>That God ſaw it good to bring Christ into his Kingdom
by a bloody way.</hi> Dr. <hi>Downing</hi> told the Artillery-men, <hi>It was
lawful for Defence of Religion to take up Arms against the King:</hi> And ſo
did Mr. <hi>Calamy; 'Tis commendable to fight for Peace and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the King's Command.</hi> And in a Sermon <hi>Decemb.</hi> 25. 1644. he
calls them <hi>the</hi> Judas<hi>'s of</hi> England <hi>that made their Peace
with the King at</hi> Oxford. <hi>What a ſad thing is it,</hi> ſaith Mr.
<hi>Caſe, to ſee our King in the Head of an Army of</hi> Babylonians,
<hi>refuſing, as it were, to be called the King of</hi> England, Scotland,
<hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and chooſing rather to be called the King of</hi>
Babylon; Serm. on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. 1644. p. 18.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> in a Sermon to the <hi>Commons, Nov.</hi>
5th. <hi>Anno</hi> 1644. exhorts them to do Juſtice to the greateſt;
Saul<hi>'s Sons are not ſpared, nor</hi> Agag, <hi>or</hi> Benhadad,
<hi>though Kings. Brooks</hi> to the <hi>Commons, Decemb.</hi> 26.48. Set
ſome of<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65960:48"/>theſe Grand Malefactors in Mourning, that
cauſed the Kingdom to mourn ſo many Years, in Garments rouled in Blood by
the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice. Mr. <hi>Love</hi> was choſen as the fitteſt
Perſon to aſſiſt at the Treaty at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> who in
compliance with the ſenſe of his Maſters, called <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>
and <hi>Liturgy, Two Plague Sores,</hi> and tells the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>That while their Enemies go on in wicked practiſes, and they keep their
Principles, they may as ſoon make Fire and Water,</hi> nay he had almoſt
ſaid, <hi>Heaven and Hell to agree; it is the Sword, not Diſputes that
muſt end this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: Wherefore turn your Plowſheres into Swords,
and your Pruninghooks to Spears to fight the Lords Battles, to avenge the Blood
of the Saints which hath been ſpilt: It muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged by us, or upon us.
I have prayed that too much pitty in our State Phyſicians, do not retard the
healing of the Land; here are Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Humours in the Nobles and Gentry to be
purged out, before they be healed. O that in this our State Phyſicians would
reſemble God, to cut off thoſe from the Land who have diſtempered
it.</hi> You may know what he means by his Latin ſentence, <hi>Melius pereat
unus, quam unitas,</hi> Men that be under the guilt of much Innocent Blood, are
not fit to be at Peace with, till all the guilt of Blood be expiated by the
Sword of the Law, or the Law of the Sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaith he at his Execution, <hi>I did in
my place and calling oppoſe the Forces of the<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65960:48"/>late King,
and were he alive again, and I ſhould live longer, the Cauſe being as then
it was, I ſhould oppoſe him longer:</hi> But the preſent Power ſaw it
not fit to truſt him with a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Life. And it is very remarkable, that
<hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> the <hi>Atturney General</hi> repeated moſt of thoſe
paſſages which Mr. <hi>Love</hi> had urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King and his
Party, to ruine them, to ſhew that he ought not to have any Mercy ſhewed
him: See the Printed Tryal of Mr. <hi>Love.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> pag. 67.
<hi>of his Life,</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Souldiers, ſaid he was ſo like
to</hi> Love, <hi>that he would not be right till he was ſhorter by the
head.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> acted more wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as he ſays, p. 84.
<hi>of his Life,</hi> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wars he had Fourteen Years Liberty in ſuch
ſweet imployment, and that in times of Uſurpation when under a Rightful
King and Governour, he was laid by as a broken Veſſel, ſuſpected and
vilified, ſcarce Tolerated to live privately and quietly in the Land. But if
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had complied but half ſo much with the rightful
Government in things lawful, as he had done with uſurped Powers in things
unlawful, he might have lived more than twice as long, as quietly and godly as
other good Men did. Yet after the clamour of his Sufferings, he thrived in
thoſe worſt Times (as he accounted them) for he had a ſtock of Money, out
of which he could ſpare a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound to the <hi>Exchequer,</hi>
intended moſt of it for pious uſes (as he ſays) <hi>p.</hi> 89.
<hi>part</hi> 3.<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65960:49"/>But in Seven years he endeavoured a
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Houſe or Land, but could not find it: So that he perceived the
Devils reſiſtance of it, and that there are Devils that keep up a War
againſt Goodneſs in the World; yet he found the Devil did not hinder his
disburſing almoſt as great a Sum to build a Synagogue for his Conventicle.
He did not thrive ſo well in the Service of the Army; for his Arrears of many
hundred pounds were never paid him: Nor was he dealt with as Mr. <hi>Love. Ille
cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ſceleris precium tulit hic diadema.</hi> But to return: This, or
ſome other Relick of this Aſſembly (who themſelves ran before they were
ſent) did ſend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to the Army, under <hi>Cromwel</hi>
after the King's death, where he ſays he accompanied Commiſſary-General
<hi>Whaley,</hi> a Perſon who was ſometime the King's Jailor, and whom you
may find in that black Liſt of his Majeſty's Judges; a fit Conductor and
great Confident of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s; to him Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> dedicates
his <hi>Apology,</hi> by the Name of <hi>The Honourable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>With this <hi>Achitophel</hi> our <hi>Shemei</hi> hunts
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> from Mountain to Mountain, curſing and railing at him as he
goes; the Sword of his Tongue being longer and ſharper than his furbiſhed
Sword. <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, and <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of
the Lord deceitfully,</hi> and <hi>Curſed be he that holdeth back his Sword
from Blood,</hi> were the common Texts of the Army-Chaplains: And the Maxims of
his<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65960:49"/>
                  <hi>Holy Commonwealth</hi> were the Subjects of ſome
of his Sermons.</p>
               <p>He ſays in the Epiſtle to his firſt <hi>Plea for Peace, My
honeſt Friend,</hi> (a Proſelyte of his, whom, it ſeems, he had engaged
in the War) <hi>when he ſaw here a Leg, and there an Arm, (was faint-hearted,
and) ſaid it was time for him to ſtop.</hi> But the valiant Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> though he had ſeen many ſadder ſights, even the
Carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſome Thouſands, Streams of Blood, the Ruine of Cities,
Towns, Churches, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, goes on as undauntedly as <hi>the Horſe that
ruſheth into the Battle.</hi> Let the Reader view (if he can without horrour)
what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> reports of himſelf in two Epiſtles dedicated to
two of his Army-Saints. In that to <hi>Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Providence
did ſo clear his way</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in that War) <hi>and draw him on,
and ſweeten unuſual Troubles with unuſual Mercies, and iſſue all in
Teſtimonies of Grace, that he had great mixtures of Comfort with Sorrow in
the performance. And that he had more eminent Deliverances and other Mercies in
thoſe years and ways of Blood and Dolour, than in moſt of his Life
beſides.</hi> It ſeems he was of the mind which our Saviour foretold of
ſome, that ſhould kill his Diſciples, and think they did God Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He
adds: <hi>The beſt is, we now draw no blood,</hi> (it ſeems he had done
that ſufficiently) <hi>they were now as Conquerours to divide the Spoil.</hi>
And great things did this Champion promiſe himſelf, though it appears that
he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65960:50"/>of his hopes: For in another
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Colonel <hi>Berry,</hi> whom <hi>(Stilo Novo)</hi> he calls
Honourable too, as being one of the Council of State, he thus expoſtulates;
<hi>Was I not capable of Secular and Military Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as
others?</hi> (it ſeems he thought ſo, but they did not) <hi>Did I ever
ſollicite you as much as for my Arrears, which is many hundred pounds?</hi>
(it ſeems he had ſerved them long, and was well promiſed for his pains;
but this Man of Conſcience was content with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing work of drawing
Blood <hi>gratis:</hi>) he ſcorn'd to open his mouth for the many Hundreds
due to him, hoping they would have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Man of ſo generous a Spirit to
ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Military Preferment, whereof (his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
notwithſtanding) he thought himſelf ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. But this great Warriour,
partly through regret at his diſappointments, of which he complains
<hi>p.</hi> 2. of his Epiſtle before his <hi>Saints Everlaſting
Reſt,</hi> againſt <hi>ungrateful men;</hi> and partly through his bodily
infirmities (for however <hi>willing his Spirit</hi> was, his <hi>Fleſh
was</hi> grown <hi>weak</hi>) being exhauſted by the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of War: For
in the ſame Page he tells us, that <hi>being in his Quarters far from home,
he was caſt into extream languiſhing by the ſudden loſs of about a
gallon of Blood,</hi> (which ſhould have minded him of the many Gallons of
Blood whereof he had been the cauſe of effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) <hi>after many years
foregoing weakneſs, by which his Body was ruined beyond hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65960:50"/>the ſentence of preſent death being by the ableſt
Phyſicians paſt upon him; from which he was delivered by a wonder in the
midſt of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> in the War) <hi>and was ſupported
four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years in a languiſhing eſtate, wherein he had ſcarce a waking
hour free from pain.</hi> And thus (though againſt his will) he is forced to
leave the Army. And might not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> juſtly ſay (and the
Reader believe him in this) as he writes in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Hill—I
have been in the heat of my Zeal ſo forward to changes and ways of blood,
that I fear God will not let me have a hand in the peaceable building of his
Church?</hi> And the Judgment of God is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently upon him, who hath been ſo
far from building, that it hath ever ſince been his great buſineſs to
deſtroy the beſt eſtabliſhed Church in the World; which will appear, by
taking a view of this mortified Man in his retirement from the War. And we find
him ſitting down on the ſequeſtred Living of Mr. <hi>Dance</hi> at
<hi>Ked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminſter;</hi> he had inticed many of that place and neighbourhood
to the War, and ſome few returned with him again. How far he was given to
Plunder in the time of War (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath been accuſed) I affirm not; but
it will draw a ſhrewd ſuſpicion on him, that he was not afraid to take a
Horſe or two in time of War, who ſeized on the Perſon of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to
ſerve as an Exchange for his Father; and poſſeſſed himſelf of the
Livelyhood of Mr. <hi>Dance,</hi> of whom he confeſſed, as the then Bp. 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65960:51"/>of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 3. informs,
<hi>That he was a Man of an unblameable Life and Converſation, though not of
ſuch Parts as might qualifie him for the Cure of ſo great a
Congregation.</hi> And though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was not welcomed here by a
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle (as he was at 
<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Relation of
this in a Poſtſcript to his <hi>True Catholick,</hi> p.
294.</note>
                  <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,</hi> where the Report is, that it rained Manna on
the Church wherein he was to officiate;) yet he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by Providence,
(as he ſays in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle) <hi>That it is the Will of God it ſhould be
ſo:</hi> (a ſtrange Argument, from God's permiſſion of an unrighteous
Act, that it is his Will it ſhould be ſo!) <hi>For this</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>I clearly diſcerned in my firſt coming to you, in my former abode with
you, and in the time of my forced abſence from you.</hi> But the truth is,
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had too much adhered to the Presbyterian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to be
advanced by that Army; though he deſires them to remember how far he had gone
with them in the War, and pleadeth their acknowledgment that a ſpecial
Preſence of God was with the Parliament; and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on them the Sin of
forcing out 140 Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers firſt, and then 120, and <hi>their proclaiming it
Treaſon to ſay that the Parliament was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And then he urgeth
thoſe Scriptures to them, which himſelf had ſhewn them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to
contemn, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and that they might know his
meaning, he tells them, That <hi>the ſecluded Members were the beſt 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65960:51"/>Governours in all the World; that they had the Supremacy,
and yet had been reſiſted and depoſed in</hi> England. It was a Sin with
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to oppoſe the Uſurpers, and a Duty to reſiſt the
King and fight againſt him; which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did for four years
together: And <hi>it is to be believed</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>)
<hi>that a man would kill him againſt whom he fights,</hi> p. 423. <hi>Holy
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was not very conſtant to his own
Profeſſion concerning his long beloved Parliament: For in the ſame place
and breath almoſt, he ſays, <hi>Secondly, I mean the Powers that were
laſt layed by,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Richard</hi> and his Parliament; of whom he
ſays, as to <hi>Richard,</hi> That <hi>he piouſly, prudently, and
faithfully, to his immortal honour, did exerciſe the Government, how ill
ſoever you have uſed him.</hi> But wherein did all this Piety and Prudence
appear? was it that he did inherit from his Father <hi>Oliver</hi> a tender
care of the Cauſe of Chriſt? of which you ſeem to give an inſtance in
the Proteſtants of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> when it was notorious, that a great
part of the Charity of the Nation for their Relief, was employed in maintaining
the War againſt the King. Was it that at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a few of his
Officers, he diſſolved that Parliament of his? Was it in ſwearing that he
would to the utmoſt of his power maintain and preſerve the juſt Rights
and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the People, and govern accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law? which he could
not do. Was<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65960:52"/>it in making a tame Submiſſion to ſome of
his Army, calling them <hi>The preſent Government,</hi> from whom he expected
Protection, and held himſelf obliged to live peaceably under them, and to
procure to the utmoſt of his power that others ſhould do ſo too? Theſe
things argue no great ſtock of Piety, Prudence, or Faithfulneſs. And as to
<hi>Richard</hi>'s Parliament, which had an Upper Houſe conſiſting
moſtly of Military, Mechanical, and Fanatick Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; a Lower Houſe of Men
of none or very ill note: Of this Parliament Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, He
<hi>never had known a Parliament more inclined to Piety and Peace;</hi> (the
Long Parliament not excepted) whereof he gives this inſtance: Becauſe it
was their deſire to have ſetled Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions according to Mr.
<hi>Baxter's</hi> advice, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> to keep out all whom he calls
<hi>ungodly,</hi> from chuſing or being choſen. See the Preface to the
<hi>Holy Commonwealth.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like, were they of whom Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>They were the beſt Governours in all the World,
ſuch as they had ſworn and ſworn to obey again and again; ſuch as might
not be impoſed on pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and that he would with great rejoycing
give a thouſand thanks to that Man that would acquaint him of one Nation in
the World that had better Governours in Soveraign Power, as to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and
Wiſdom conjunct, than theſe, who yet had been reſiſted and
depoſed.</hi> It ſeems Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> could have been eaſily
reconciled to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Governours, but thoſe to whom of right the 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65960:52"/>Government did belong. And any Reader converſant in Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s Writings, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> never
complained ſo much of Arbitrary Government and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under any of
the Revolutions of Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Powers, as he hath done ſince the King and
Church were reſtored; nay, he wrote as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly for Obedience to
ſome of them, as he hath ſince to incourage Diſobedience to theſe. And
let me deſire the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what ground Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had
for his great veneration of the <hi>Secluded Members,</hi> more than for
thoſe who were called <hi>the Rump.</hi> Did not they agree in that
accurſed Vote of <hi>Non-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes</hi> to the King before their
Secluſion? Did not they upon their re-admiſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforce the
<hi>Engagement to be true and faithful to the Commonwealth, without a King or
Houſe of Lords?</hi> Did not ſome of them provide <hi>an Oath of
Abjuration</hi> of the King, to be taken by ſuch as were to ſit in the
Council of State? Did not ſome of them ſend to General <hi>Monk</hi> to
adviſe him that he muſt take that Oath, before his admittance into that
Council? Did they not offer to ſettle <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> on Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Monk,</hi> and deſire him to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on himſelf, under
what Title he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And becauſe they did this, (and might juſtifie
themſelves in ſo doing, upon Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s <hi>Theſes</hi> in
his <hi>Holy Commonwealth</hi>) they are (all theſe things notwithſtanding)
the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Powers, the beſt Governours in all the<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65960:53"/>World,
and ſuch as to reſiſt, is to incur Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> during the time of his abode at
<hi>Kedderminſter,</hi> was not employed in writing only, as he did againſt
Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> juſtifying the Trade of Sequeſtrations; and againſt
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, repreſenting them as Men that had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hatred to Sin, nor love
to Godlineſs or common Honeſty; becauſe, he ſays, they <hi>publiſhed
ſo many, ſo groſs and ſhameleſs Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, and over-acted the
part of the Accuſers of the Brethren,</hi> p. 308. of <hi>Poſtſcript</hi>
to the <hi>True Catholick.</hi> But he was employed alſo in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commiſſioners for Sequeſtrations, <hi>p.</hi> 297. <hi>ibid.</hi> Yet
he excuſeth the matter, and ſays, He <hi>never perſecuted or caſt out
any, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured it by word or deed, unleſs for notorious ſcandal or
inſufficiency;</hi> and we know that Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> and ſuch as he,
were then account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch, as not having the Grace of God in them. Upon
ſome ſuch account it was, that Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Pocock</hi> were ejected, to the perpetual Infamy of the Ejectors.</p>
               <p>How vainly doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtill plead for
Sequeſtrations, <hi>p.</hi> 78. of his <hi>Apol.</hi> Firſt, <hi>That the
Miniſters were ejected by the Secular Power.</hi> But were not they animated
by the Clergy, who, as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> had then no Benefices? Secondly,
<hi>That ſome of the Pariſh were the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, Witneſſes, and
Sollicitors.</hi> And ſuch may be ſtill found in moſt Pariſhes where
there are very good Miniſters. But, Thirdly,<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65960:53"/>
                  <hi>The
People ſhould not be left as Heathen, and therefore 'tis an excuſable
errour; and when the love of Souls makes them ſpend themſelves for the
Peoples good, this ſhould not be thought their unpardonable Crime. And they
did think that the Salary was for the Work; and if they had a lawful Call to
the Work of the place, they thought they had ſo to the Salary.</hi> Now
though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> framed theſe Reaſons for them, he adds, <hi>I
juſtifie not their Reaſons; but my Opinion is, That being young Men
moſtly in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, that had little or nothing of their own, they
could not well otherwiſe have got Bread and Clothing, much leſs Fire,
Houſe-room,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe young Men could better have ſhifted for
their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, than by turning ſo many aged Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with Wives and
Children, out of all. Of ſuch as ſay, <hi>We may do evil that good may come
of it,</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Their damnation is juſt.</hi> But Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> concludes, <hi>p.</hi> 79. <hi>To ſay the truth, many of them
thought it a good work, yea very good, to caſt out thoſe</hi> (thouſands
of them whoſe Livings were deſirable, by falſe Accuſations) <hi>as
inſufficient or vicious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are that <hi>learned, godly, faithful Clergy,</hi> who
to requite Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> hath choſen him their Prolocutor, to
juſtifie them in all their Diſobedience and Violences, and to accuſe the
Conformiſts of Perjury, Perſecution, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heinous Sins, in thoſe
Books which he calls his <hi>Pleas for Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65960:54"/>Becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks
himſelf abuſed in the account which Mr. <hi>Durel</hi> and others have
given of his Sequeſtration at <hi>Kedderminſter,</hi> take his own account.
In the year 40. the Parliament began to Sequeſter ſuch Miniſters as
appeared moſt Loyal: and ſo early the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Kedderminſter</hi>
article againſt their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car: it was worth then about Eightſcore pounds
<hi>per Annum,</hi> (now more.) The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car fearing to loſe all, is forced to
give a Bond of 500<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> to pay 60<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi>
yearly to a Lecturer. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is invited to accept of it, and holds
it for a year and half, being driven off by the Wars, which he followed four
years, and thinks it a kindneſs that he did not ſue the Vicar for his
60<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> per Annum,</hi> which he did nothing for. But at his
return, the Vicar is ſequeſtred by a Committee, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is
importuned to take it; which he refuſeth to do in his own name, but thus it
was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>I got all the Magiſtrates and Chief of the Town together,
who openly ſubſcribed to give me</hi> 100<abbr>l.</abbr> per Annum, <hi>as
their Lecturer; and that no part of this ſhould accrue from the
Vicaridge.</hi> But mark the Juggle! He ſaid immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>I told
them, that by an Augmentation which I had procured, making my</hi>
60<abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>an</hi> 100<abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>and a Houſe, I would be
their Lecturer as before.</hi> This 60<abbr>l.</abbr> was to come out of the
Vicaridge, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Proviſo to the contrary. But the
Sequeſtrators, who gathered the Tythes, gave him no account; nor needed they:
if it<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65960:54"/>be true that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had 80 or
90<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> and an Aſſiſtant about
60<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> more, there was not much left for the Vicar. But Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> asked them whether any of the Money they gave him came out of
the Tythes? They told him, the 60<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> due by Bond, and an
Augmentation granted by Parliament, was more than he had; <hi>(i.e.)</hi> all
that he had came out of the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, though it were not full as much as was
promiſed him: for the Bond and Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came to
100<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </hi> whereas he received but 80 or
90<hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> And they uſed my name</hi> (ſaith Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>in letting the Tythes: for they had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily got an Order
to put me in the ſequeſtred Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caridge; which when I knew, I conſented
to, for their indemnity.</hi> So that after all his Art to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the guilt of
a Sequeſtrator, it is plain the Vicaridge was ſequeſtred in his name, the
Tythes agreed for in his name, the Pay was made out of the Tythes; and to all
this, though <hi>poſt factum,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> conſented. <hi>And
this was my taking the Sequeſtration,</hi> p. 81. of <hi>Apol.</hi> I know
that ſome Perſons have minded Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to make Reſtitution;
but he thinks he had a Right to it, and wants but a Secular Power to place him
in it again; yea, he thinks himſelf wrong'd that he hath not the fifth part
ſtill payed him: for, <hi>p.</hi> 85. <hi>Eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers allowed the Wives of the ſequeſtred
Miniſters the fifth part; for my part, I never asked you ſo much.</hi> He
expected to have it offered him as his due, without asking. But I ſuppoſe
his<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65960:55"/>many hundred pounds of Arrears from the Army, and his
Fifths from <hi>Kedderminſter,</hi> will be payed together.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, the Protector <hi>Oliver</hi> never
had any reſpect for him: and he would now perſwade the World that he had as
little for the Protector; although in an Epiſtle to his Son <hi>Richard,</hi>
before the <hi>Key for Catholicks,</hi> he thus applauds him: <hi>The ſerious
Endeavours of your Renowned Father for the Proteſtants of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
<hi>diſcovered to the World by Mr.</hi> Morland, <hi>hath won him more
eſteem in the hearts of many that fear the Lord, than all his Victories in
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered: We pray that you may inherit a tender Care of the
Cauſe of Chriſt.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> could not be ſo great a
ſtranger as to be ignorant how the Charity of the People, which was very
large at that time, was abuſed, and employed to very ill uſes; yet with Mr.
<hi>Baxter, Oliver</hi> is as <hi>David,</hi> and his Son <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> as
<hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Key for Catholicks</hi> was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> where he gives this Character of himſelf:
<hi>One that rejoyceth in the preſent happineſs of</hi> England, <hi>and
wiſheth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly that it were but as well with the reſt of the World;
and that honoureth all the Providences of God by which we have been brought to
what we are: One that concurs in the common hopes to theſe Nations under your
Government.</hi> And in another Epiſtle before his <hi>Five Diſputations of
Church-Government,</hi> when all Religions were<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65960:55"/>tolerated,
except that of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (to prevent the toleration of
that) he ſays, <hi>If you give Liberty to all that is called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, you
will ſoon be judged of no Religion, and loved accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Party behaved themſelves
during the Impriſonment of the King, and while he was in the hands of his
Murderers, they are not willing to diſcover. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for his part
ſays, That he proved in the times of Uſurpation, that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
deteſted it, that the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters printed their Abhorrence of
it to the World, Preface to <hi>Second Plea.</hi> As for the
<hi>London</hi>-Miniſters, I read, that about 59 of them in number pleaded
for the King in theſe words: <hi>That the woful Miſcarriages of the King
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which we cannot but acknowledge to be very many and great in his
Government, have coſt the three Kingdoms ſo dear, and caſt him down from
his Excellency into a horrid Pit of Miſery beyond example.</hi> This <hi>Plea
for the King</hi> is like their late <hi>Pleas for Peace,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi>
Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Schiſm and Sedition;) for in it they ſay enough to
excuſe the Regicides: <hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge,</hi> (i.e. we affirm
and bear witneſs) <hi>that the woful Miſcarriages of the King himſelf,
not of his evil Counſellors only, but his perſonal Crimes and fundamental
Errours in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, too many and great to be here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have coſt
the three Kingdoms ſo dear, as that all the Bloodſhed, and Rapine, and
Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65960:56"/>that have been made in</hi> England,
Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>might be charged on him; and for theſe
he is juſtly caſt down from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency into ſo horrid a pit of
Miſery beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;</hi> (i.e.) <hi>Though the like were never done in
the World, he is juſtly fallen under a Sentence of Condemnation.</hi> As to
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar abhorrence of that barbarous Fact, and his
proving that the Presbyterians deteſted it, I ſuppoſe the place he refers
to, is his <hi>Key for Catholicks,</hi> p. 321, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſays in
<hi>p.</hi> 323. That <hi>the Caſe of Murdering our King, differs very much
from the Powder Plot, or Papiſts murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Kings, and teaching that it is
lawful for a private hand to do it. A War, and a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Murder, are not
all one; nor is a part of the Soveraign Power all one with a private hand,</hi>
p. 324. I have read what <hi>John Goodwin</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> have written
in Vindication of that horrid Murder, and do believe that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
hath out-done them both. Let the Reader ſeriouſly peruſe that part of his
Writings (which he quotes to prove the contrary) from <hi>p.</hi> 323. to
<hi>p.</hi> 326. and I believe he will be of the ſame opinion: for the
deſign of it is to prove, that, (<hi>p.</hi> 323.) <hi>If the Body of a
Commonwealth, or thoſe that have part in the Legiſlative Power, and ſo in
the Supremacy, ſhould unwillingly be engaged in a War with the Prince, and
after many years Blood and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, judiciouſly take away his Life, as
guilty of all this Blood, and not to be truſted any more with 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65960:56"/>Government; and all this they do, not as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, but
as the remaining Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſay they do according to Laws:
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Caſe differs very much from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts murdering of Kings. I
ſpeak not this by way of Juſtification,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
p. 325. <hi>whether they were in the right or wrong; I am not the Judge: but
ſurely it was the Judgment of the Parliament upon the Diviſion,</hi>
(between the King and them) <hi>the Power was in them to defend themſelves
and the Commonwealth, and ſuppreſs all Subjects that were in Arms against
them; and that thoſe that did reſist them, did reſist the Higher Powers
ſet over them by God, and therefore were guilty of the Damnation of
Reſiſters.</hi> And this they aſſured the People was a Truth: And ſo
hath Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> done too in his <hi>Political Aphoriſms</hi> more at
large; but expreſly enough in this place, where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of
<hi>Grotius,</hi> p. 324. he aſſerts, <hi>That the Legiſlative Power
being divided between the Prince and Senate, the Prince invading the Senates
Right, may juſtly be reſiſted, and loſe his Right.</hi> And this was
well underſtood by all that engaged in the War againſt the King from the
beginning, that in caſe they Conquered the King, he was no more to be
truſted with the Government: <hi>For if it were known before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,</hi>
(ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>that if they ſhould purchaſe a Victory by
their Blood, when they have done all, they must be all governed by him, whom
they have conquered, and lye at his mercy, they<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65960:57"/>would hardly
ever have an Army to defend them.</hi> So that the King was never more to be
truſted <hi>(i.e.)</hi> either with Government or Life.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the cited
Preface intimates, that he was Beheaded for his Loyalty; which I think he
ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, in theſe two paſſages: (Not to take
notice here of his barbarous inſulting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that truly <hi>great
Prelate</hi> when he was brought to the Block, waving his Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and
crying out, <hi>Art thou come, little</hi> Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the one, in
his Sermon at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge: It was the Lord that troubled</hi> Achan, <hi>and
cut him off becauſe he troubled</hi> Iſrael. <hi>O that in this our State,
Phyſicians would reſemble God, to cut off thoſe from the Land that have
diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it;</hi> (and he tells us plainly whom he means) <hi>Melius
pereat unus quam unitas: Men that lye under the guilt of much Innocent Blood,
are not fit perſons to be at peace with, till all the guilt of Blood be
expiated and avenged, either by the Sword of the Law, or by the Law of the
Sword, elſe the Peace can never be ſafe or just.</hi> The other paſſage
was, in his Speech, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. of his Trial; where ſpeaking of his
oppoſing the Tyranny of a King, he ſays, <hi>I did, it is true, in my place
and calling, oppoſe the Forces of the late King; and where he alive again,
and ſhould I live longer, the Cauſe being as then it was, I ſhould
oppoſe him longer;</hi> That is, he had lived, and would die a Rebel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65960:57"/>An hundred Inſtances of ſuch fatal
Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on that excellent Prince, have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Sermons and
other Writings of Men of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Perſwaſion; and yet to
ſhew that he dares do any thing to juſtifie his Party, he makes a bold
Challenge to thoſe whom he calls their Accuſers, to ſhew, if they can,
what Body or Party of Men on Earth have more ſound and loyal Principles of
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Obedience. And yet they have preacht and publiſht to the
World the ſame Doctrines which were voted <hi>January</hi> the 4th, 1648.
<hi>That the Repreſentative of the People in Parliament have the Supream
Power of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whatever is enacted or declared for Law by the
Commons in Parliament, hath the form of a Law; and the People are concluded
thereby, though the Conſent of King and Peers be not had thereunto.</hi>
Which Votes were paſſed in order to the King's Trial.</p>
               <p>Were not they the King's moſt Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that carried on
a War againſt him, until they made him their Priſoner, and then uſed him
as a captiv'd Slave, denying him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a Man, the ſociety of Wife,
Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and any Attendant whom he could truſt; and of a Chriſtian,
denying him the aſſiſtance of his Chaplains; leaving him no Comfort that
might make his Life deſirable, but perpetually baiting him with the
Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſuch unreaſonable Propoſitions as they knew before-hand
the King could not in<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65960:58"/>Honour or Conſcience comply with?
Being thus bound and chain'd, the Independants take him out of their hands, and
put an end to his Sufferings. <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> a great Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
himſelf, truly repreſents the Caſe: <hi>If a Thief</hi> (ſays he,
<hi>p.</hi> 353. of his <hi>Defenſio Regia</hi>) <hi>apprehends a Traveller,
diſarms him, robs him of his Money, and leaves him naked, and faſt bound to
ſome Tree, and ſome ravenous Beaſt finding him in that condition, kills
and devours him; to whom ought the cauſe of his Death to be imputed? to the
Thief, or to the Beaſt?</hi> And he concludes, <hi>Ita juſtum Regem &amp;
ſanctum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinxere Presbyteriani.</hi> Theſe diſarmed him of his Militia,
theſe bought and ſold him as a Captive, theſe covenanted to preſerve
his Life, with a Condition of his preſerving their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which when he
ſhould refuſe, they thought themſelves bound by Covenant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
him. The Army in a Remonſtrance from St. <hi>Albans,</hi> Novemb. 16. ſay,
that <hi>Whereas it might be objected that the Covenant obliged them to
preſerve the King's Perſon:</hi> They ſay, <hi>It was with this
reſtriction, In the preſervation of the true Religion. Religion and Publick
Intereſt were to be underſtood the principal and ſupream Matters engaged
for; the King's Perſon and Authority were inferiour and ſubordinate; which
being not conſiſtent with the preſervation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Publick
Intereſt, they were by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant obliged againſt it.</hi> And what was
it leſs that the Commiſſioners of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65960:58"/>of the <hi>Scots</hi> reſolved on, <hi>viz. That if the
King were excluded from Government in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>for not granting the
Propoſitions concerning Religion and the Covenant, it was not lawful for that
Kingdom to aſſiſt him for the recovery of his Government?</hi> (yet this
is that <hi>Solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> for the obligation whereof Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſo contumaciouſly pleads, againſt the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the
whole Nation.) And upon theſe and ſuch like Propoſals from
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament vote, <hi>That no more Addreſſes be made
from them to the King, nor any Letters or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage received from him:</hi>
And, <hi>That it ſhould be Treaſon for any perſon to receive Letters from
the King, or deliver any to him, without leave from both Houſes.</hi> And
were not theſe the King's moſt Loyal Subjects? Or what Body or Party of Men
have in Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> ſence more ſound or loyal Principles of
Government and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
               <p>How often and how deeply this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable King was wounded at
the heart by thoſe barbarous Declarations of the Parliament and Presbyterian
Incendiaries, as if he were a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, worthleſs, faithleſs Perſon,
not to be truſted in his moſt Solemn Proteſtations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his
Intentions for Tyranny and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is beyond any Man's expreſſions but his
own? Theſe had often murdered him in his Honour and Reputation before his
laſt Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Nor could his laſt Speech ſilence thoſe malicious
Blaſphemies; he was no ſooner<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65960:59"/>dead, but he was executed
in his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and as much as lay in the
power of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, rob'd of that immortal Jewel more worth than his
Crown, though no Man was ſo qualified for ſuch pious and excellent
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations as himſelf. Thoſe two Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Epiſcopacy againſt
<hi>Henderſon,</hi> and a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of Presbyterians at <hi>Newport,</hi> of
which his greateſt Enemies could not deny him to be the genuine Author,
ſufficiently ſhew his great Abilities both for Learning and Acurateneſs
of Stile; of which Debates the Biſhop of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ſays, that
his Majeſty underſtood the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Church as well as any
Biſhop in it, and defended it with as clear and ſtrong Reaſons, whereof
that Learned Biſhop made great uſe againſt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
oppoſition of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> p. 271, &amp; 280. of his <hi>Hiſtory
of Separation.</hi> Yet from the beginning of the War to the end of the Life of
that beſt of Kings, and I may add to the end of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Life,
no one hath endeavoured to defame him more, and render him odious to
Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> by charging him with granting
Commiſſions to thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts that maſſacred Two
hundred thouſand Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was diſabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate any longer
with the Sword, yet is he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do it with the Pen, which he dips not
in Gall and Vinegar, but in the very Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Aſps, to keep open the
Wounds of<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65960:59"/>the expiring Church: To which end he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to draw his Neighbour-Miniſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>an Aſſociation,</hi> and
procures the <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire Agreement;</hi> the deſign of which you
may ſee in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Gildas Salvianus,</hi> which was
intended as a Humiliation Sermon to thoſe that would enter into the
Aſſociation; not that they ſhould humble themſelves, but the Clergy
that yet adhered to the King: For one effect of it was, the promoting a
Petition, <hi>That notoriouſly inſufficient and ſcandalous
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> (and as ſuch, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> repreſented the Loyal
Clergy; though, as himſelf obſerves in the ſame Book, the Synod of

forbidding them not only the Exerciſe of their Miniſtry, but of keeping any

carried in the Negative by two Voices only;</hi> yet, like another

might) <hi>for reproaching not as by hear-ſay, but from ſight and feeling,
first, the Silencing of moſt godly able men, the Perſecution even of the
peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the diſcountenance of godlineſs, and the inſulting ſcorn of
the profanest in the Land.</hi> And <hi>many hundred ſwearing, drunken,
ignorant, ſcandalous, negligent Miniſters are cast out, and we have now
many humble, godly, painful Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in a County.</hi> And as for the People,
he ſays in the ſame Epiſtle to his <hi>Gildas, That most of them wherever
he came, did make Religion, and reading the Sacred Scriptures, or ſpeaking of
the way to Heaven, the matter of their bitter ſcorn and reproach.</hi> He
ſpares not to Revile the Royal Martyr, as if he intended to juſtifie his
Murder: <hi>King</hi> Charles (ſaith he) <hi>by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops inſtigation,
kept Mr.</hi> Pryn <hi>long in Priſon, and twice cropt his Ears for writing
againſt their Masks and Plays, and the high and hard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the
Prelates; though the Archbiſhop</hi> (whoſe Head they cut off for leſs)
<hi>ſhewed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Crimes, of which he was proved guilty,</hi> in his Speech
in the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> This was not <hi>ſuch a faſt as God required,
to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burthens, to break
every yoak, and to let the oppreſſed to free.</hi> This was the
Hypocrite'<hi>s fast for ſtrife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> and <hi>to ſmite with the
fist of wickedneſs,</hi> and to <hi>make their voice to be heard on
high,</hi> Iſai.<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65960:60"/>58.4. in the words of the proud
Phariſee, <hi>God I thank thee, I am not as other men, nor as this
Publican,</hi> as will appear to him that reads <hi>chap.</hi> 4.
<hi>ſect.</hi> 1. and <hi>p.</hi> 154. where he raileth intolerably againſt
the Rulers, as <hi>Haters of practical godlineſs, and of all that would but
ſpeak ſeriouſly of Heaven, and tell Men of Death and Judgment, and
ſpend the Lord's day in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration thereto; that did but pray in their
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or reprove Drunkenneſs or Swearing.</hi> What could any Papiſt
ſay more to diſparage the Church of <hi>England?</hi> As to the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Clergy, he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 157. <hi>The Churches were peſtered with
abundance of meer Readers, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, Profane, and Debauched Men: and many that
had more plauſible Tongues, made it their chief buſineſs to bring thoſe
they called Puritans into diſgrace. So that I must needs ſay, I knew no
place in thoſe times</hi> (for he ſpeaks of Men and Places within his
knowledge) <hi>where a Man might not more ſafely have been drunk eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Week,
than to have gone to hear a Sermon if he had none at home.</hi> Nor doth he
ſpare thoſe that died long before his memory, <hi>p.</hi> 143. <hi>What
Toys and Trifles did the ancient Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church peſter the
Church with? And what uſeleſs Stuff are many of their Canons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of? Three lamentable Vices did the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church commonly abound in;
Pride the Root, and Contention and Vain-glory the Fruit, &amp;c.</hi> to
<hi>p.</hi> 149. where he is not aſhamed to tell the World what Troubles the
firſt Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65960:61"/>raiſed at <hi>Frankfort</hi>
againſt thoſe Reformers and Confeſſors that were Exiled for maintaining
the ſame Worſhip and Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for the defence of which many Biſhops and
Miniſters were ſuffering Martyrdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Papiſts. <hi>No ſooner
were they</hi> (the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts) <hi>called home,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>p.</hi> 150. <hi>but ſome of them were ſo intemperate, impatient, and
unpeaceable, that ſome turned to flat Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and flew in the faces of
the Prelates with reviling.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth the ſame, and
accounts the requiring of Uniformity in the ſame or a better Worſhip, to be
a Perſecution. As for his Brethren, he profeſſeth to believe,
<hi>That</hi> England <hi>never had ſo able and faithful a Miniſtry ſince
it was a Nation as at this day, viz.</hi> Decemb. 4. 1655. in the heat of
Rebellion; yet he affirms, <hi>Sure I am, the change is ſo great within
theſe Twelve years, that it is one of the greatest joys that ever I had in
the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it.</hi> But for the Prelatical Party, he brings in
ſome, ſaying, <hi>They are all empty, careleſs, if not ſcandalous and
ungodly men.</hi> And may we not conclude, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth,
<hi>p.</hi> 167. <hi>This is not a confeſſing ſin, but an applauding
thoſe whoſe ſins they pretend to confeſs?</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
calls this Book <hi>Gildas Salvianus;</hi> but he might have more truly
entitled it <hi>Excidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Britannicum:</hi> for that followed on it.</p>
               <p>How Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can be excuſed from the guilt of
Schiſm, in the departing from the Communion of the Church, after his
Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65960:61"/>and Subſcription, and Solemn Vows then made,
for more than Twenty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Impoſitions and Penalties enjoyned by
the Secular Powers, which he pleaded in his juſtification after the year 63.
will be a very difficult, if not an impoſſible work to him that conſiders
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s circumſtances and actings. I ſhall therefore only
ſhew the heinous nature of that Sin, as deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 741. of his <hi>Chriſtian Directory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Schiſm is a ſin against ſo many clear and
vehement words of the Holy Ghost, that it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly without excuſe;
Whoredoms, and Treaſon, and Perjury are not oftner forbidden in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
than this. That it is contrary to the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Christ in our
Redemption, which was to reconcile us all to God. That it is contrary to the
deſign of the Spirit of Grace, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtianity; a ſin
against the nearest bonds of our higheſt relations; a dividing of Christ, or
robbing him of a great part of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. That it is accompanied with
Self-ignorance, Pride and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankfulneſs to God. That Church-dividers are
the most ſucceſsful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Devil, and ſerve him more
effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally than open Enemies. That it is a ſin which contradicteth all
God's Ordinances and Means of Grace; a ſin againſt as great and lamentable
Experiences, as almost any ſin can be; and this is a heinous aggravation of
it, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly juſtified, and not repented of by thoſe that 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65960:62"/>commit it; and the more heinous, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
fathered upon God: Therefore remember this, that Schiſm and making Parties in
the Church, is not ſo ſmall a thing as many take it for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this pious Man, to keep his Proſelytes from ever returning
or repenting for Schiſm, tells them in the Preface to his <hi>Plea for Peace,
That more like truth hath been ſaid for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Anabaptiſm,
Polygamy, Drunkenneſs, Stealing and Lying in caſe of Neceſſity, than
any thing he ever yet read of for a full Conformity,</hi> as he their
deſcribeth it. Behold here the great Charity of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> which he
extends ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Congregations of Schiſmatical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, and
ſuch as live in thoſe deteſtable ſins of Polygamy, Drunkenneſs, Lying
and Stealing, than to the moſt Solemn Aſſemblies of Conformiſts, to
which yet he hath often joyned himſelf in Communion. How great ſoever his
Knowledge was, how ſtrong ſoever his Faith, yet wanting Charity, the Sacred
Scripture aſſures us, that ſuch a Man is but as <hi>ſounding Braſs or
a tinkling Cymbal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1658. juſt Ten years after that the beſt of
Kings ſuffered by the worſt of Men, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſets forth his
<hi>Grotian Religion;</hi> and through <hi>Grotius</hi>'s ſides, ſtrikes at
the Head and Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with one blow: For
<hi>the Grotian deſign</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> Popery) <hi>was carrying on,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>in the Church of</hi> England; and <hi>that this was the 
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65960:62"/>cauſe of all our Wars and Changes in</hi> England,
<hi>p.</hi> 105. 
<note place="margin">Another Cauſe of the War not
Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal.</note> where he thus talks concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Martyr, beyond
any thing that his barbarous Judges could accuſe him of.—<hi>How far
the King was inclined to a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (with the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>I only deſire you to judge:</hi> 1. <hi>By the Articles of
the Spaniſh and French Match ſworn to.</hi> 2. <hi>By his Letter to the
Pope written in</hi> Spain. 3. <hi>By his choice of Agents in Church and
State.</hi> 4. <hi>By the Reſidence of the Pope's Nuntio here, and the
Colledge of the Jeſuits,</hi> &amp;c. 5. <hi>By the illegal Innovations in.
Worſhip ſo reſolvedly gradatim introduced. All which I ſpeak
not with the least deſire to perſwade Men that he was a Papist—but
only to ſhew, that while he as a moderate Proteſtant</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> a
Papiſt in Maſquerade, as they are now termed) <hi>took hands with the Queen
a moderate Papist, the</hi> Grotian <hi>deſign had great advantage in</hi>
England, <hi>which he himſelf boaſted of,</hi> p. 106. Of this indignity to
that Religious Prince, the Learned Biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> p. 617. of his
Works, took notice, and vindicated him: of which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told by a Book called the <hi>Impleader,</hi> who ſaid only, that Mr.
<hi>Baxter gave ſeveral inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that the King was Popiſhly
affected;</hi> he numbers that among other lies of that Author, <hi>p.</hi>
100. of his <hi>third Defence;</hi> and ſays, <hi>Why did not the Man tell
where and when; and that he had printed the contrary in times of
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65960:63"/>and that he is a Calumniator unleſs he
prove it? Why did he not cite Biſhop</hi> Bramhal<hi>'s proof—and you
ſee that a Calumniator with them is no ſingular perſon; they are not
aſhamed to tell the world that their Archbiſhops lead them, and are as bad
as they.</hi> It ſeems Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was pinched by this Relation,
which makes him cry out, <hi>I have printed the contrary. See what theſe
ſort of Men are come to! What credit is to be given to ſuch Men's Reports!
Is this it in which the Authority of Archbiſhops conſiſts, that they must
be followed in ſlanders,</hi> &amp;c. I have ſaved the Impleader the labour
of quoting the place, and deſire the Reader to conſult it, and ſee how
maliciouſly and groundleſs he urged thoſe things againſt the King at
ſuch a time as that. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>he printed the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi> That time which now he calls a time
of Higheſt Uſurpation, was the ſame which he then lookt on as a
bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time, when <hi>Richard Cromwel piouſly, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and
faithfully, to his immortal honour,</hi> exerciſed the Government, 1659. and
to him he dedicated that Book, wherein he ſays he wrote the contrary,
<hi>p.</hi> 327. where having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the new Epiſcopal Party for
following <hi>Grotius,</hi> he adds, <hi>As for the King himſelf, that was
their Head, if any conjecture that he was a flat Papist,</hi> &amp;c. Mr.
<hi>Baxter believes him not;</hi> but he was <hi>the head of the</hi> Grotian
<hi>Papiſts; and he himſelf boaſted of it (ubi ſuprà.)</hi> Now
if any would know how far <hi>Grotius</hi> was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65960:63"/>(he ſays) <hi>he was a more arrant Papiſt than</hi> Caſſander,
<hi>and one that owned the Council of</hi> Trent; <hi>And ſuch I think are
flat Papiſts.</hi> And therefore it was no lie in the <hi>Impleader,</hi> to
ſay Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gave intimations that the King was Popiſhly
affected; but a groſs one in Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to deny it, and give him
the lie, as he doth impudently to others. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays,
<hi>He did not believe it himſelf, that the King was a flat Papist:</hi> Then
his iniquity was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to give ſo many inſtances by way of proof,
that others might believe it. Did not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> know that the fear of
introducing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery was made one ground of the War againſt the King? and may
he not make it a ground of another War, becauſe the King adheres to his
Biſhops, whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls <hi>Popiſh Clergy-men?</hi> And he
ſays, <hi>That the Parliament, whom they were bound to believe, made it their
great Argument and Advantage against the King, that he favoured the Papiſts;
and on this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Thouſands came in to fight
for their Cauſe.</hi> And they made one Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Archbiſhop
of <hi>Canterbury, That he endeavoured to introduce Popery,</hi> though he were
indeed one of their greateſt Adverſaries, whoſe Life on that account they
endeavoured to take away. And the Relation of Dr. <hi>Du Moulin, That at the
Death of the King, a known Papist was heard to ſay, That now their greatest
Enemy was cut off,</hi> is very credible. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knew that old
Maxime, <hi>Fortiter Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niare,<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65960:64"/>aliquid adhaerebit.</hi>
It is no honeſt Man's part, firſt to break a Man's Head, and then to give
him a Plaiſter; which if it be not too narrow to heal the Sore, or
ineffectual to cure it, yet may leave ſome ugly Scar behind.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> hath given many more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> a Papiſt, than he hath given of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt: And if his actings for Forty years together be well conſidered, it
will appear he hath been made uſe of as one of the moſt keen and Catholick
Tools that ever the Papacy did employ, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knows it or not. It is, I
confeſs, a difficult thing to tell the World what Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> was of as to Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether Epiſcopal,
Presbyterian, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant; he hath been of all, and I think he is now of
neither, having a peculiar Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of his own.</p>
               <p>In a Book called <hi>A Method for Peace,</hi> &amp;c. printed
1653. I find him to favour <hi>Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> though in other Writings he
condemned them as Superſtitious; but by a paſſage in <hi>p.</hi> 341. he
ſeems reconcileable to them: for thus he ſaith, <hi>Nothing almoſt is
wanting to us to ſet our Congregations in the Order of Christ, and to the
great Work of Reformation, ſo much as want of Maintenance for a competent
number of Miniſters or Elders to attend the Work: We have divers godly
private Chriſtians capable of helping us as Officers in our Churches;</hi> by
which I ſuppoſe he intends <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65960:64"/>I cannot certainly affirm what his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is concerning
them: for he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſet up a new Model of his own, <hi>(i.e.)</hi>
a mixture of Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Government; but declares
for neither of them. It is more certain, that he once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf
a Conformiſt, and diſputed for Biſhops and Liturgy as by Law
eſtabliſhed; and he thought he had ever the better: yet if it be true that
he had a prejudice againſt them ever ſince he was Nineteen years old, it
was rather to betray than defend them. But in an Aſſize-Sermon preached
1654. at <hi>Worceſter, p.</hi> 191. he pleads for the Presbyterian
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in theſe words: <hi>How long hath</hi> England <hi>rebelled
against his</hi> (Chriſt's) <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Mr.</hi> Udal <hi>told them in
the days of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>That if they would not ſet up the
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Christ in the Church, Christ would ſet it up himſelf in a
way that ſhould make their hearts to ake: I think</hi> (ſaith Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>their hearts have aked by this time; and as they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to the Gallows for his Prediction, ſo hath Christ executed them by
Thouſands for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against him.</hi> Now it is evident what
Diſcipline <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal</hi> meant, by his Confederacy with <hi>Coppinger,
Penry,</hi> &amp;c. of which <hi>Cambden,</hi> p. 420. of his <hi>Eliz.
Angl.</hi> ſays, <hi>Some of thoſe Men who were great Admirers of the</hi>
Geneva Diſcipline, <hi>thought there was no better way for eſtabliſhing
it in</hi> England, <hi>than by railing againſt the Engliſh Hierarchy, and
ſtirring up the People<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65960:65"/>to a diſlike of Biſhops.</hi>
They therefore ſet forth ſcandalous Books againſt the Government of the
Church, and Prelates; as <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate, Minerals, Diotrephes, A
Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c. In which Libels they ſet forth
virulent Calumnies, and opprobrious Taunts and Reproaches, in ſuch manner, as
the Authours ſeemed rather Scullions out of the Kitchin, than pious and godly
Men: yet the Authours were <hi>Penry</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal,</hi> Miniſters of
the Word. Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> quoteth a Pamphlet of Mr.
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal</hi>'s, called <hi>A Dialogue,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>That the
Biſhops Callings are meer Antichriſtian,</hi> p. 59. of <hi>Dangerous
Poſitions;</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 45. he ſays, <hi>They were very deviliſh
and infamous Dialogues, and that there was a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy between</hi>
Coppinger, Wigginton, <hi>&amp;c. by ſome extraordinary means</hi> (ſuch as
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal</hi> had propheſied ſhould make their hearts to ake) <hi>for
releaſing of ſome that ſtood in danger of their lives; meaning, as I
ſuppoſe,</hi> ſays the Biſhop, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal, Newman,</hi> &amp;c. The
dangers threatned by ſuch extraordinary means to diſturb the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment,
haſtned the Trial of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal,</hi> who with three others, took occaſion
from the intended Invaſion in 88, to alarm the Nation at home; as alſo they
did on the Powder Plot, and to this day do, by ſcattering ſeditious
Pamphlets. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal</hi> was charged with a Book called <hi>A
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Diſcipline which Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in his Word
for the government of his Church, in all times and places to the Worlds
end.</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65960:65"/>The Preface was directed <hi>To the ſuppoſed
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church of</hi> England; to whom he ſays, <hi>Who can deny
you, without bluſhing, to be the cauſe of all ungodlineſs, ſeeing your
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is that which giveth leave to a Man to be any thing, ſave a
ſound Chriſtian? for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it's more free in theſe days to be a
Papist, Anabaptist, of the Family of Love, yea, as any most wicked, rather than
what we ſhould be: And I could live theſe Twenty years as well as any
ſuch in</hi> England, <hi>yea, in a Biſhop's Houſe it may be, and never
be moleſted for it. So true is that you are charged with in a Dialogue lately
come forth, and by you burnt, that you care for nothing but the Maintenance of
your Dignities, be it to the damnation of your own Souls, and infinite
mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions more.</hi> The whole Book being like this Preface, he was indicted at
the Aſſizes held at <hi>Croyden,</hi> and found guilty. He pleaded <hi>That
he was indicted on the Statute of</hi> 23 <hi>of</hi> Eliz. c. 2. <hi>for
publiſhing ſeditious words against the Queen, but that the Book charged on
him, contained no ſeditious words against the Queen, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
only.</hi> But it was anſwered by the Judges (N.B.) <hi>That they who ſpake
against her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Government in Caſes Eccleſiaſtical, her Laws,
Proceedings, or Eccleſiastical Officers which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under her, did defame
the Queen.</hi> And on clear proof that he was the Authour of that Libel, he
was found guilty, and received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death; but by interceſſion of
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> was Reprieved. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65960:66"/>actings have been ſo like Mr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal</hi>'s, that it
is no wonder to find him labouring to juſtifie him in a Cauſe wherein
himſelf is ſo nearly concerned.</p>
               <p>In 1659. came forth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Key for
Catholicks,</hi> dedicated <hi>To his Highneſs</hi> Richard <hi>Lord
Protector,</hi> p. 323. where he aſſerts, <hi>That if the Body of a
Commonwealth, or thoſe that have part in the Legiſlative Power, and ſo in
the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, ſhould be unwillingly engaged in a War with the Prince,</hi>
(<hi>ſuppoſe the Long Parliament, or the Commonwealth under</hi> Oliver
<hi>against King</hi> Charles <hi>the First</hi>) <hi>and after many years
Blood and Deſolations, judiciouſly take away his Life as guilty of all this
Blood, and not to be truſted any more with Government, (as the Parliaments
Vote for Non-addreſs to the King.) And all this they do, not as Private Men,
but as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Soveraign Power, and ſay they do it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law;
undoubtedly this caſe doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much differ from the Powder Plot, or
Papiſts murdering of Kings.</hi> With much more to the ſame evil purpoſe.
And doubtleſs the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is great; it is more horrid for Subjects to
pretend Juſtice, than for the Pope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by ſecret Plots to deſtroy
a Proteſtant Prince. In the year 58. he prints his <hi>Five Diſputations of
Church Government;</hi> which were deſigned againſt reſtoring the
extruded Epiſcopacy and Liturgy, and to juſtifie the Presbyterian
Ordination, where (as alſo in his <hi>Method for Peace,</hi> p. 389.) he
ſaith, <hi>We have<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65960:66"/>taken down the ſuperfluous honour of
Biſhops,</hi> (viz. <hi>their power over Presbyters.</hi>) <hi>as
Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> This diſputatious Book (he ſays) was written
againſt Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who was then his Neighbour; and he dealt very
friendly with him: for he ſcarce touched one of his Arguments, but the
deſign of the Book was to deſtroy the whole Order, as <hi>Optatus</hi>
ſaid of a Donatiſt, <hi>Dei Epiſcopos linguae gladio jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſti,
fundens ſanguinem non corporis ſed hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> Opt. Milevit. l. 2.</p>
               <p>And becauſe after <hi>No Biſhop</hi> follows <hi>No
King,</hi> in 1659. he ſets forth his <hi>Holy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;</hi> which was
no other than a Plot to keep out the <hi>King,</hi> as the other was to keep
out the <hi>Biſhops:</hi> for there being great hopes that upon ſo many
Revolutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhould ſettle again on our ancient
Foundations, he ſays, <hi>He ſuited that Book to the demands and doubts of
thoſe times.</hi> And his endeavour is to prove, <hi>That the King being
ſecluded, and his Subjects diſcharged of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ought not to be
readmitted.</hi> Thus in the Preface: <hi>That a Succeſſion of wiſe and
god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men, may be ſecured to the Nation in the highest Power, is that I have
directed you the way to in this Book.</hi> And thus he explains himſelf:
Firſt, as to the higher Powers; <hi>Prove,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the King
was the highest Power in the times of Diviſion, and that he had power to make
that War that he made, and I will offer my Head to Juſtice as a Rebel.</hi>
Theſe<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65960:67"/>confident, Aſſertions of his were ſuch as
brought a far better Head to the Block. But what would Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
have? <hi>My wiſh is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that our Parliaments may be holy,
and this aſcertained from Generation to Generation, by ſuch a neceſſary
Regulation of Elections, that all thoſe who by wickedneſs have forfeited
their Liberties</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the King and Loyal Party) <hi>may neither
chooſe nor be choſen. And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Elections to faithful, honest,
upright men, ſuch as</hi> (he ſays) <hi>were then in</hi> Richard
Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel<hi>'s Parliament, is the only, only, only way to a certain and
perpetual Peace and Happineſs.</hi> He commends <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> as
<hi>one that inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited his Father's Vertue;</hi> one that <hi>piouſly,
pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and faithfully, to his immortal Honour, exerciſed the
Government;</hi> perſwades <hi>all men to live in obedience to him;</hi> and
ſtiles himſelf (in the Epiſtle to his <hi>Five Diſputations,</hi>
deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his favourable acceptance of the tendered Service of) <hi>a
faithful Subject to his Highneſs, as an Officer of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
King,</hi> R.B. Doth not this Man affirm, notwithſtanding all the Confuſion
that had covered the Land, all the Blood that had been ſhed, and all the
Hereſies and Blaſphemies that had poiſoned millions of Souls, that he is
one that <hi>rejoyceth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happineſs of</hi> England, <hi>and
honoureth all the Providences of God by which we have been brought to what we
are?</hi> Epiſtle Dedic. to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> before his <hi>Key for
Catholiks;</hi> and in his <hi>Holy Commonwealth,</hi> p. 487. <hi>Nor can I be
ſo<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65960:67"/>unthankful as to ſay, for all the ſins and
miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Men ſince, that we have not received much mercy from the
Lord.</hi> And therefore he ſets up his Stone of Remembrance, with this
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in great Letters: <hi>HITHERTO HATH THE LORD HELPED
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, that a Man who hath ſaid and done ſuch
barbarous unnatural Deeds, and ſtirred up many Thouſands to do and ſay
the ſame things with him, ſhould ſtill deceive the meaneſt
Chriſtians? Is it poſſible he ſhould ſtill perſiſt in the ſame,
and yet retain the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a Saint? and be reputed the chiefeſt Guide of
a Godly People? Yet thus it is: He is conſulted as the Oracle of the
Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts; <hi>All of them,</hi> as a late <hi>Encomiast</hi> ſays,
<hi>do light their Fires at his Torch.</hi> And he hath the forehead with the
ſtrange Woman, to <hi>wipe his mouth, and ſay, What have I done?</hi> You
may gueſs by what he ſays: <hi>I must profeſs, that if I had taken up
Arms in that War againſt the Parliament,</hi> (he ſays it, <hi>p.</hi> 488.
of <hi>Holy Commonwealth</hi>) <hi>my Conſcience tells me I had been a
Traytor, and guilty of reſiſting the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers.</hi> And in his
<hi>Key for Catholicks,</hi> where the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> and
<hi>higheſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Power</hi> is divided by Conſtitution of the
Government <hi>between the Prince and Senate,</hi> (as he determines the
Engliſh Monarchy to be) he ſays modeſtly there, many will think; but he
elſewhere delivers it as his own Sentiment, <hi>That the Prince invading the
Senates Right,<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65960:68"/>may juſtly be reſiſted and loſe his
Right,</hi> p. 324. Yet this Man ſays, <hi>Further than I was for the King, I
never was one year with the ſtronger ſide:</hi> As if he had been always
Loyal. And <hi>p.</hi> 489. of <hi>Commonw. If any of them</hi> (i.e. his
Accuſers) <hi>can prove that I was guilty of hurt to the Perſon, or
deſtruction to the Power of the King, or of changing the Fundamental
Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Commonwealth,</hi> (not the Kingdom) <hi>taking down the
Houſe of Lords without conſent of all three Eſtates that had a part in
the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; I will never gain-ſay them if they call me a most
perfidious Rebel, and tell me that I am guilty of far greater ſin than
Murder, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Drunkenneſs.</hi> And <hi>Anno</hi> 1680. he is not
aſhamed to ſay in his Preface to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the
<hi>Nonconformiſts Plea,—In all the times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, and
ſince, I ſaid and wrote that the King's Perſon is inviolable, and to be
judged by none, either Peer or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And the Book accuſed</hi> (i.e.
the <hi>Holy Commonw.</hi>) <hi>goeth on theſe Principles.</hi> So that
notwithſtanding his pretence of recanting what was there ſaid, he ſtill
ſeems to juſtifie thoſe <hi>Theſes,</hi> and adds, <hi>The Book
accuſed hath not a word meet to tempt a Man in his wits to ſuch
accuſation:</hi> Yet he ſays, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 352. <hi>Though a Nation
wrong their King, and ſo</hi> quoad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum Cauſae <hi>they are on the
worſer ſide, yet may he not lawfully war against the Common Good,</hi>
(i.e. the rebellious Party) <hi>or on that account; nor any help him in that
War.</hi> And <hi>Theſ.</hi> 374.<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65960:68"/>
                  <hi>If a Prince that
hath not the whole Soveraignty</hi> (which he ſays of our King) <hi>be
conquered by the Senate that hath the other part, and that in a juſt
defenſive War,</hi> (as he thought the late War to be) <hi>the Senate cannot
aſſume the whole Soveraignty, but ſuppoſeth that Government</hi> in
ſpecie <hi>to remain: and therefore another King muſt be choſen.</hi>
This was pleaſing Doctrine in the Protector's time. And <hi>Theſ.</hi> 137.
<hi>If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> Succeſs in Rebellion) <hi>ſtatedly
diſable him that was the Soveraign from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Laws, protecting the
Juſt, and other ends of Government, it maketh him an uncapable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of
the Power, and ſo depoſeth him.</hi> And being ſo made uncapable of
Government, <hi>by Theſ.</hi> 146. <hi>Though he were unjuſtly
diſpoſſest, it is not the duty of his Subjects to ſeek his
Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Reader hath heard of a famous Roman Saint called
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> who, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with others of that Church, we may ſay
of him as one doth of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> That <hi>he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them as much as
a Flint doth a Freeſtone,</hi> becauſe out of him ſo many Fires have and
may be kindled. If ſuch an Hiſtorian as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> were now living,
how eaſily might he run a Parallel between theſe two Generals? Both were
famous <hi>tam Marte quam Mercurio;</hi> but whether of them was the greater
Souldier or the better Saint, might occaſion ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute; the reading
whereof would not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo ſad, as the reſtleſs endeavours of
the Diſciples of them both; who, however<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65960:69"/>they ſeem to
differ in other things, joyn all their hands to pull down our Church. Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being grown to ſuch an height, I ſhould think it a thing impoſſible
that it ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any farther, the wickedneſs and ſhame of it being
(notwithſtanding any pretence) manifeſted to all Men: and that upon the
joyful tidings of his Majeſty's moſt happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in peace, by a moſt
miraculous and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Providence, the Authours of ſuch O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and
Practices ſhould ſeek where to hide their heads. But we are told, that
<hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is as the ſin of Witchcraft,</hi> which ſeldom admits
repentance; and though they have power to do hurt, yet they have none to do
good. Hence it is that this confident Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſtill with open face, and
purſues the ſame ungodly ends. I know not how it came to paſs, but this
ſame Man was admitted to preach a Faſt Sermon to the Houſe of Commons
when they were conſulting of inviting home the King to his Father's Throne;
and with great boaſting he tells us often, That <hi>the King was called home
the next day after that Sermon of his,</hi> as if it had not been done if he
had not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: whereas it is very obſervable, that in all the Sermon
there was not one word that might be interpreted to promote that noble
Deſign, but many things that were intended to hinder it, or clog it with very
diſhonourable terms. He <hi>intimates the Supream Power to be ſtill in the
two Houſes.</hi> He tells us indeed, that <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:65960:69"/>13. <hi>is part of the Rule of his Religion,</hi> (and adds) <hi>but
unhappily there hath been a difference amongſt us which is the higher
Power.</hi> (And be it remembred, that he had offered his Head to Juſtice as
a Rebel, if any could prove that the King was the higheſt Power in the time
of Diviſion.) Whereas he himſelf confeſſeth, that a <hi>Heathen
perſecuting</hi> Nero <hi>muſt be obeyed;</hi> Yet he affirms, That <hi>it
was not the intent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of St.</hi> Peter <hi>or St.</hi> Paul, <hi>to
determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperour or Senate was Supream;</hi> though St.
<hi>Peter</hi> plainly determines it, when he calls the King <hi>Supream;</hi>
and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by appealing <hi>not to the Senate,</hi> but to
<hi>Caeſar.</hi> In that Sermon he magnifies the Loyalty of the
<hi>Presbyterians;</hi> adjures the Commons to an oppoſition of
<hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> though the King in his Meſſage commended it to be as
ancient as the Monarchy in this Iſland. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Titles of <hi>Sound
Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Church Government,</hi> pleads for <hi>Presbytery;</hi>
and would (<hi>p.</hi> 46.) have the Church Revenues ſetled on them:
<hi>p.</hi> 43. ſaying, <hi>Give firſt to God the things that are
Gods.</hi> For theſe he pleads, under the name of the <hi>godly, peaceable,
and prudent people of the Land,</hi> in oppoſition to the
<hi>prophaneneſs:</hi> And to inſinuate new fears and jealouſies, cries
out, <hi>O what happy times did we once ſee!</hi> When were thoſe happy
times? Not in the peaceable time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; thoſe
were days of <hi>Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Perſecution:</hi> He muſt mean
either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65960:70"/>the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> when ſo much
Loyal Blood was ſhed; or under the <hi>Protection</hi> of <hi>Oliver,</hi>
when the <hi>beſt of Princes</hi> was butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or under <hi>Richard,</hi>
of whom and his Mock-Parliament he gives ſuch large Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums. But now,
<hi>Nox una perpetuo manſura,</hi> The days of Light and Jubilee are gone:
And (as it is with Bats and Owls) when the Sun appears, their Night is come. He
was it ſeems of the ſame mind with his Brother <hi>Jenkins,</hi> who ſaid
in a Sermon preached <hi>Sept.</hi> 25. 1656. <hi>That the removal of
Prelatical Innocations coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervailed for the Blood and Treaſure ſhed and

               <p>IF <hi>Great Theodoſius,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays,
(<hi>Treatiſe of Biſhops,</hi> part 1. p. 147.) <hi>did caſt himſelf
down on the Earth before</hi> Ambroſe <hi>to beg pardon and re-admiſſion
with tears, and was not received till ſome Months continued pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi> If
<hi>Great</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> being ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a Criminal as he hath
under his own hand acknowledged, ſhould, after ſuch a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous return of
the King, humble himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and his Nobles in ſuch manner as
he promiſed once he would do; it was no more than was his duty, and perhaps
not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to expiate his Crime. Thus then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> expoſtulates,
<hi>p.</hi> 14. of his Anſwer to <hi>Bagſhaw: Is it poſſible for any
ſober Chriſtians in the World to take them to be blameleſs, or thoſe to
be little ſins? What, both the violating the Perſon and the Life of ſo
good a King? and the change of the fundamental Government or Conſtitution?
The ſetting up the Protector, and pulling him down again?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If
all this were no Rebellion, Treaſon, or Murder, is there any ſuch Crimes to
be committed? If I was guilty of ſuch ſins,</hi> (Habemus confitentem Reum)
<hi>I do openly confeſs, that if I lay in ſackcloth and in 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65960:71"/>tears, and did lament my ſins before the World, and beg
pardon both of God and Man, and beg all Men to take warning by my fall, which
had done ſuch unſpeakable wrong both to Chriſt and Men, I ſhould do no
more than the plain Light of Nature aſſureth me to be my great and needful
duty,</hi> p. 17.</p>
               <p>But he that had the confidence to meet the old King and his
Armies in the Field, (now that the Sword is taken out of his hands) wants not
confidence to take up his Pen, as dangerous a Weapon, and moſt maliciouſly
handled, and to affront the then preſent King before he be well ſetled on
his Throne, <hi>in this Military way,</hi> as he terms it in his <hi>Third
Plea, page</hi> the laſt. And though his Fraternity could not be permitted to
bring him under Articles before, yet they vigorouſly attempt it after his
return. The firſt attempt was concerning a Declaration to be extorted from
the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Eccleſiaſtial Affairs: <hi>We offered his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and
the Biſhops, at firſt, the Archbiſhop</hi> Uſher<hi>'s Model for
Concord: Treatiſe of Epiſc.</hi> Part 2. p. 53. The Biſhops would not
once take it into conſideration, nor ſo much as vouchſafe to talk of it,
or bring it under any delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They knew whence it came, not from the
Archbiſhops, but the Presbyterian Forge: Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſeth,
<hi>p.</hi> 87. ſecond part, <hi>They that would have conformed to his
Majeſty's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> (which, as you ſhall hear anon, they had
cauſed to be drawn according to their<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65960:71"/>Model) <hi>went on
this Suppoſition, that the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Prelacy was altered by it: and yet on
theſe terms they would unite with the Prelatiſts, only ſo far as to go in
a peaceable performance of their Office, p.</hi> 116. (juſt as now they do.)
In that 116 <hi>p.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſuppoſeth this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
againſt the Declaration; (for I can ſcarce call it his Majeſty's, being
by the neceſſity of times, and the importunity of troubleſome Men,
extorted from him.) Obj. <hi>You did but obtrude on us your own Opinions: for
when you had drawn up most of thoſe words, his Majeſty was forced to ſeem
for the preſent to grant them to you, for the quieting of you.</hi> Anſw.
<hi>p.</hi> 117. <hi>If we did offer ſuch things,</hi> (for it was in vain to
deny it) <hi>let the World judge what we ſought by them.</hi> 2. <hi>There is
most of that about Rural Deans put in, I ſuppoſe, by the Biſhops
conſent, who were to word it after it went FROM <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> (a good office
indeed, to whet a Sword to cut their own Throats, and be the Presbyterians
Journey-men to their own undoing.) For Thirdly, <hi>Whoever mentioned or
deſired it? it appears that the work of Juriſdiction, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
Abſolution, no nor Ordination, was not thought to be above the Office of a
Presbyter;</hi> that is, They would have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Biſhops of all their
Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and taken it to themſelves; and then they would go on
peaceably in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their Office: and therefore it is no wonder
that the Biſhops refuſed to conſider<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65960:72"/>of ſuch a
Model, <hi>And that very Parliament that had ſo much manners as to thank his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for that Declaration</hi> (which others have not done for the Act of
<hi>Oblivion</hi>) <hi>did lay it by, ſo that it was never done, but other
Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed which we feel,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot paſs by that vain-glorious boaſting of his ſo
often mentioned, how ſoon the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> and he was
agreed as to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c. in half an hour:</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, <hi>in a quarter of an hour:</hi> when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Model which he calls
the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's, was publiſhed after the beginning of our Wars, to put a
ſtop to that utter Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then intended by the total Extirpation of
Epiſcopacy, and not as a Pattern for 1660. He ſays, one Mr. <hi>Stanly</hi>
of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> told him, <hi>That Archbiſhop</hi> Uſher <hi>did
profeſs to him, that he took a Biſhop to be</hi> Primas Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterorum,
<hi>of the ſame Order; and every Presbyter to be a Governour of the
Flock:</hi> and when he asked him, <hi>Why then he would be a Primate?</hi> he
told him, <hi>That he took it not for any part of his Office, but for a
collateral Dignity which the King was pleaſed to beſtow on him.</hi> And
<hi>that Biſhop</hi> Reynolds <hi>profeſſed to him his Opinion to be the
ſame when he took the Biſhoprick.</hi> At Biſhop <hi>Reynolds</hi> I
cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; perhaps he cared not for the Species of Epiſcopacy, which
this Opinion of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys, but the ſubſtantial advantage: His
Biſhoprick was managed partly by his Wife,<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65960:72"/>who viſited
the Conventicles, and his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, <hi>who,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 184. of <hi>Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, had been a
Judge-advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in</hi> Fairfax<hi>'s or</hi> Cromwel<hi>'s Army.</hi> But that
Archbiſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> who ſo long and ſo lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exerciſed
the Juriſdiction of an Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, ſhould act againſt his Judgment and
Conſcience, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> ſhall ever make
ſuch as knew any thing of that good Man to believe: ſomething he might do
in that neceſſary time, for the reduction of the Church, which was then in
a miſerable confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſome order and government; but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended that Model which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls his, and which altered the
very Species of Epiſcopacy, for the reduction of Epiſcopacy. The Biſhop's
Practice for ſo many years, is an undeniable Argument of his Judgment for
Epiſcopacy. Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> confutes all ſuch Slanders, having
recorded the Archbiſhop's Judgment in theſe words: <hi>Holding as I do that
a Biſhop hath S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PERIORITY IN DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GREE ABOVE A PRESBYTER, you may eaſily
judge that the Ordination made by ſuch Presbyters as have ſevered
themſelves from thoſe Biſhops unto whom they had ſworn Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Obedience, cannot poſſibly be excuſed by me from being
Schiſmatical.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath well obſerved, That
<hi>Faction is one of the greateſt Lyars</hi> (and I may add, <hi>the
greateſt Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers</hi>) <hi>in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65960:73"/>It is uſual with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> from
the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Men in Caſes of Neceſſity, to frame an Argument
againſt their free and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Judgment; as he hath moſt
injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dealt with his late Majeſty in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to the
Nineteen Propoſitions of the Parliament, which he made for Peace ſake,
wherein he condeſcended to part with much of his right, but could not be
heard. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>Armagh,</hi>
March 22. 1624. and died <hi>March</hi> 21. 1655. ſo that he continued in
that See 31 years, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs did not act againſt his Conſcience all
that time. I cannot give you his Judgment in all our controverted Points: One
thing is very conſiderable which he delivered in a Speech at the Caſtle of
<hi>Dublin</hi> before the Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the great Aſſembly,
<hi>April</hi> the laſt, 1627. concerning a Supply of Money to be granted the

me leave as a Divine to tell you plainly, that to ſupply the King with means
for the neceſſary defence of the Country, is not a thing left to your own
diſcretion either to do or not to do; but a matter of Duty, which in
Conſcience you ſtand bound to perform. The Apoſtle,</hi> Romans 13.
<hi>having affirmed, that</hi> we muſt be ſubject to the Higher Powers, not
only for Wrath, but Conſcience ſake, <hi>adds this as a reaſon to confirm
it;</hi> For, for this Cauſe you pay Tribute alſo; <hi>as if the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch payment could not ſtand with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65960:73"/>Subjection: thereupon he infers this Concluſion,</hi> Render
therefore to all their due, Tribute to whom Tribute, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom
is due, <hi>agreeable to that known Leſſon which he had learned of our
Saviour,</hi> Render unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, &amp;c. <hi>where you may obſerve, That as to with-hold
from God the things which are Gods, Man is ſaid to be a robber of God,
whereof he himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in caſe of ſubſtracting Tythes: ſo to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Supply to</hi> Caeſar <hi>of ſuch means as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for
ſupport of his Kingdom, can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no leſs than a robbing of him of
that which is his due; which I wiſh you ſeriouſly to
conſider</hi>—And in this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and many of his
Perſwaſion will be Diſſenters from the Archbiſhop, and ſo they
would from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del alſo; for why elſe did they not ſhew any
readineſs to accept it when it was firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Nothing would
pleaſe them then, but <hi>the Extirpation of Epiſcopacy Root and
Branch.</hi> And ſecondly, the Archbiſhop's Model pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that Species
of <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would deſtroy,
and (Thirdly) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes Chriſt's true
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline impracticable. Nor will any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pleaſe Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> as long as the <hi>Liturgy is eſtabliſhed,</hi> which he
fancieth to abound with many heinous ſins, whereof, as long as any one is
retained, <hi>Conformity</hi> is to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:65960:74"/>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath been always
oppoſing the Party that was uppermoſt. He began with the <hi>King and
Biſhops:</hi> then with the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> oppoſing their Doctrine
in the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, ſee <hi>p.</hi> 20. of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi> And their Diſcipline by <hi>Lay-Elders.</hi> And
<hi>p.</hi> 83. of his <hi>Apology, When the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſeemed
uppermoſt, I was looked on as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter: When the</hi> Rump <hi>was
uppermoſt, I was by their order</hi> (de jure) <hi>Sequeſtred: With
the</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>I was out much more:</hi> Cromwel <hi>was not for me,
becauſe I was not for him.</hi> And yet he was ſo much for him, as to leave
it on record, That <hi>if the Lord Protector had not ſtept in all the
Miniſtry had been taken down.</hi> And <hi>whence came it,</hi> (ſays he,
<hi>p.</hi> 321. of his <hi>Key for Catholicks</hi>) <hi>that</hi> Sexby
<hi>and others that have been Souldiers in our Armies, have confederated
with</hi> Spain <hi>to murder the Lord Protector? And whence came their
Jeſuitical Treaſonable Pamphlets,</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Killing no
Murder,</hi> whoſe Author is known to be no Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit) <hi>provoking Men to
take away his Life?</hi> Whence is it that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> prays that his
Son <hi>Richard</hi> might <hi>inherit a tender care of the Churches of
Chriſt,</hi> if he were ſo much againſt <hi>Oliver?</hi> The plain truth
is, he was neither for <hi>Oliver</hi> nor <hi>Richard,</hi> but ſo far only
as to hinder the return of <hi>his Majeſty</hi> and <hi>the Church</hi> to
their lawful and ancient Rites. In his gracious Declaration concerning
Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Affairs, his Majeſty deſired the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65960:74"/>
                  <hi>to read as much of the Common Prayer as they had no
juſt Exceptions againſt.</hi> But though Mr.<hi>Baxter</hi> and others of
his Brethren had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that <hi>they could uſe the greatest part of
it,</hi> we never heard that they gratified his Majeſty in the reading ſo
much as one Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; but inſtead thereof, they petition for <hi>a
Reformation both of Doctrine and Diſcipline:</hi> and particularly, they
petition his Majeſty <hi>that ſome Learned, Godly, and Moderate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of
both Perſwaſions, indifferently choſen, may be employed to compile ſuch
a new Form,</hi> as they there deſcribed, <hi>or at leaſt to reviſe and
effectually reform the old,</hi> &amp;c. The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the firſt part, of
making a <hi>New Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;</hi> and tells them he had in his Declaration of
<hi>Octob.</hi> 25. expreſſed <hi>his eſteem of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of the
Church of</hi> England: but grants the ſecond, and authorizeth certain
Perſons <hi>to adviſe upon and review the ſaid Book, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the
ſame with the moſt ancient Liturgies: And, if reaſon be, to make ſuch
reaſonable and neceſſary alterations, corrections, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as
ſhould be thought needful,</hi> &amp;c. with this ſpecial
caution—<hi>Avoiding as much as may be, all unneceſſary abreviations
of the Forms and Liturgy wherewith the People are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> And how
thankfully was this received? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us, <hi>That he drew up
another Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, a Petition for Peace and Concord, and a Reply to the Anſwer
of the Biſhops to their Exceptions:</hi> This new Liturgy, though he 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65960:75"/>confeſſeth it had <hi>many imperfections,</hi> and
<hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be amended,</hi> being <hi>the haſty off-ſpring of eight
days;</hi> yet he pedantically calls it their <hi>more correct</hi> Nepenthes,
<hi>and proteſts before God and Men againſt the doſe of</hi> Opium
<hi>which was by the Biſhops preſcribed,</hi> (i.e.) the Liturgy which the
King recommended to them) <hi>as that which plainly tended to cure their
Diſeaſe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing of Life, and to unite them in a dead Religion.
Dr.</hi> Reynolds <hi>(he confeſſeth) bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them for offering a new
Liturgy inſtead of additional Forms;</hi> but they would have their
<hi>New</hi> (or) <hi>nothing:</hi> And tells the Biſhops, <hi>If theſe be
all the abatements and amendments you will admit, you ſell your innocency and
the Churches peace for nothing;</hi> (which is indeed ſomewhat cheaper than
that for which his Brethren ſold the <hi>King,</hi> and thoſe other things
to boot.) I have heard it credibly reported by ſome Reverend perſons there
preſent, that that Treaty might have had the deſired effect of Concord, had
not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted: Particularly, the
Learned Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> told Mr. <hi>Iſaak Walton,</hi> that
Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>There was a certain perſon there</hi>
(Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows whom he meant) <hi>that appeared to be ſo bold,
troubleſome, and illogical, as forced the meek Doctor to ſay, with an
unuſual earneſtneſs, that he never met with a Man of more pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Confidence, and leſs Abilities, in all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi> And the
Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> in his Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 13.
affirms, <hi>That</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65960:75"/>
                  <hi>furious
eagerneſs to engage in a Diſputation to which his Brethren ſhewed
themſelves unwilling,</hi> did <hi>wholly fruſtrate the way that tended to
an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and fair compliance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Petition for Peace</hi> then, was like his
<hi>Pleas</hi> now, meer threatning and reviling. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſays
he, <hi>p.</hi> 5.) <hi>how you drive men by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties upon that which they
judge doth tend to their Damnation.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>The denial of
their deſires would renew all our troubles.</hi> p. 18. they tell the
Biſhops of <hi>unmerciful Impoſitions.</hi> Nor did they deal better with
the King, whom they deſired to leave out of his Declaration theſe words:
<hi>We do not in Our Judgements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the practice of thoſe particular
Ceremonies we except againſt to be in it ſelf unlawful;</hi> that is, we
account them unlawful. They tell the Biſhops in the cloſe of the Second
Paper, <hi>If they will grant thoſe favours, it would revive their Hearts to
daily and earneſt Prayer for their proſperity:</hi> But <hi>p.</hi> 12.
<hi>Should we loſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of our deſired Reconciliation, it
aſtoniſheth us to foreſee what doleful effects our Diviſions would
produce; which we will not ſo much as mention in particular, leſt our words
ſhould be miſunderſtood.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 117. of their Reply:
<hi>As</hi> Baſil <hi>ſaid to</hi> Valens <hi>the Emperour, that would have
him pray for the life of his Son, If thou wilt receive the true Faith, thy Son
ſhall live; which when he refuſed, he ſaid, The will of God be done with
thy Son: So we ſay too, If you will put on Charity, and promote the Churches
Peace, God<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65960:76"/>will honour you; but if you will do contrary,
the will of the Lord be done with your Honours.</hi> Now what greater
inſolency could they have uſed, if the King had been as low as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Biſhops as obnoxious as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Brethren; And who
but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> could have thought by <hi>a haſty work of eight
days,</hi> done in oppoſition to his Majeſty's Commiſſion, and as he
confeſſeth, againſt the advice of ſome of his more ſober Brethren, to
juſtle out the Liturgy compoſed by many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confeſſors, and
approved of by the Reformed Churches ever ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as his
Majeſty tells him in that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? To which, though they <hi>now</hi>
ſay they would have ſubmitted, yet could they not <hi>then</hi> at his
Majeſties requeſt read any part of the Liturgy; though they confeſſed
they could have uſed almoſt the whole: But inſtead thereof, his Majeſty
complains in that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of their <hi>reſtleſs Spirits,</hi> who
continued their bitterneſs againſt the Church, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raiſe
Jealouſies againſt his Majeſty; and unſeaſonably Printed,
Publiſhed, and Diſperſed a Declaration to his Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
Their whole <hi>Petition</hi> was a Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Remonſtrance of <hi>their
own Godlineſs and Abilities,</hi> and the <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> of ſuch as
were not of their Perſwaſion; beſides their frequent and fearful outcries
of <hi>Perſecution</hi> and <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> when themſelves had been
the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for Twenty Years together, and as yet<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65960:76"/>had ſuffered nothing but from their own guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conſciences, and
juſt fears.</p>
               <p>Well might the Loyal Party have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Complaints,
as once their Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Brethren did: <hi>Is there the leaſt ſhew of
Oppreſſion, Sorrow, or cauſe of Complaint, except it be that you are not
ſuffered to oppreſs, vex, and gall your Brethren that joyn not with you?
Can you feed upon nothing but the Blood of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that</hi> though you
are as capable of all Preferments, even Biſhopricks and Deanaries, as any of
the Loyal Clergy) <hi>you complain of Slavery and Oppreſſion, becauſe you
cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave and lead into Captivity? Is this to kill you with the Sword,
that you cannot</hi> (again) <hi>kill your Brethren with the Sword?</hi> See
more to this purpoſe in the <hi>Pulpit-Incendiary,</hi> printed 1648.
<hi>p.</hi> 45. Your Renowned Protector <hi>Oliver</hi> ſpeaks home to you at
the diſſolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1654, in theſe words: <hi>Is it
ingenuous to ask Liberty, and not to give it? What greater Hypocriſie, than
for thoſe who were oppreſſed by the Biſhops, to become the greateſt
Oppreſſors themſelves ſo ſoon as the Yoak was removed?</hi> And his
Majeſty in the Chapter concerning <hi>the Ordinances againſt
Common-Prayer,</hi> to this effect: <hi>I ſee that thoſe are the moſt
rigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors upon others to conform to their illegal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, who were
leaſt diſpoſed to the due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lawful Conſtitutions: So that I
know not whether they ſinned more againſt their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by violently
oppoſing Our eſtabliſhed Order, or<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65960:77"/>violently
impoſing their own.</hi> We have one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more of their dutiful
behaviour to his Majeſty, in a Pamphlet called <hi>The due Account and
Petition,</hi> which was after the Debate; where they ſay, <hi>We muſt
needs believe, that when his Majeſty took our conſent to a Liturgy to be a
Foundation that would infer our Concord, you</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> his Majeſty)
<hi>meant not that we ſhould have no Concord but by conſenting to this
Liturgy without any conſiderable alterations.</hi> Whereby they would caſt
the Odium of the Rupture on his Majeſty, which they themſelves
notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cauſed; being reſolved before-hand (their Profeſſion in
a Liturgy, and accepting his Majeſties Commiſſion only to make ſome
<hi>reaſonable Alterations and Additions,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) to have a
<hi>new,</hi> or rather <hi>no Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;</hi> but to be left at liberty to
uſe their own Liturgy, or extemporary Effuſions in all the moſt Solemn
Adminiſtrations. And whether their Hypocriſie or Inſolency in dealing
thus with his Majeſty, to whom they owed their lives, were greater, let the
Reader judge.</p>
               <p>The Kings Commiſſion dated <hi>March</hi> 25th in the 13th
of his Reign was directed to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual number of Divines, as well on the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Church Party as of the Diſſenters; among theſe, two, that
had been <hi>Covenanters,</hi> were made Biſhops, being eſteemed Men of
Moderation and Learning <hi>(viz.)</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynolds.</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Gauden:</hi> Three others were of the <hi>Smectimnian Club (viz.) Edmund
Calamy,<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65960:77"/>Matthew Newcomen,</hi> and <hi>William
Spurſtow,</hi> who wrote ſeveral ſcandalous Pamphlets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Epiſcopacy and Liturgy, in Anſwer to the Right Reverend Biſhop
<hi>Hall,</hi> the reſt were Perſons that had been educated under the
Diſcipline of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Directory.</hi> Among theſe we
find Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> who had made himſelf conſiderable by his
Turbulent Spirit and Bitter Zeal againſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy and Liturgy, ever
ſince the Year 1640, and was become the Head and Protector of divers
Factions. And who ſo fit to be the Diſputer and Chief Scribe in this Grand
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate as Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> It was he that drew up the Petitions and
Addreſſes to the King; It was he that in Eight days time drew up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Liturgy, or rather a Directory, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to have that received as the
Rule of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotion, to the excluding of our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which had been
uſed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> for more than One Hundred Years, and
highly approved of by all the Reformed Churches. It was he that drew up the
Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Liturgy, though not like a Wiſe Scribe, for he
brought nothing new out of his Treaſury, but only ſuch old Scruples, as had
been long before confuted by the two Arch-Biſhops <hi>Bancroft</hi> and
<hi>Whitgift,</hi> and other Divines. And theſe with many other ſuch
Factious Pamphlets he procures to be Printed and Diſperſed through the
Nation. And as is if all his Fellow-Commiſſioners were but 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65960:78"/>Cyphers, and he the only Perſon that made any Figure,
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> undertakes to be the Diſputant. At the firſt Congreſs
of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, there happened ſome Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the
Epiſcopal Party, how unreaſonable, it was to diſturb the Peace of the
Church, for ſome inconveniencies in the Liturgy, at the hearing whereof Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>He wondred at the marvellous Oſcitancy of the
Biſhops,</hi> p. 343, <hi>as miſtaking the matter to be Diſcourſed
of,</hi> for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had found out firſt Eight, then Ten,
afterwards Thirty or Forty Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Points, ſo Unlawful and Sinful, that
Men fearing God could not ſubmit to. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe, the firſt unlawful
Impoſition which was by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> choſen to be the Subject of the
firſt Diſputation, was; <hi>That to injoyn all Miniſters to deny
Communion to all that dare not kneel in the reception of it on the Lords
day,</hi> is ſinful. I ſhall not tranſcribe the whole Diſputation,
which the Reader may find, <hi>p.</hi> 346, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And only obſerve
what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſpoken concerning that Ceremony; <hi>For he
judgeth that poſture as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as for a Perſon to receive a Pardon from
his Prince upon his knees.</hi> And Part 3. <hi>Of Chriſt. Direct. That no
reaſon can been given, why a lawful thing ſhould become unlawful; becauſe
a lawful Superior doth command it, elſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Superiors might
take away all our Chriſtian Liberty, and make all things unlawful to us by
commending them.</hi> And it is obſervable, that<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65960:78"/>Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> hoped to enforce his Argument, by adding to the Queſtion of
Adminiſtring the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c. On the Lords day,</hi> becauſe
kneeling was forbidden to the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by a temporary
injunction on ſuch days in honour of our Saviours Reſurrection, but was not
intended as a ſtanding Rule, nor practiſed in after Ages in any Church: The
Caſe of Kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the <hi>London</hi> Divines, Anſwers
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, and all other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it. It can't be
expected that I ſhould ingage to Anſwer all the Cavils which Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> hath raiſed againſt Epiſcopacy and Liturgy, which makes
up well nigh one half of his Life, and indeed of his Converſation; yet I have
ſeen a little Poſthumous Book, called <hi>Mr.</hi> Richard Baxter<hi>'s
laſt Legacy, &amp;c.</hi> out of which ſufficient Arguments may be urged,
to confute all the Objections which he hath made in this, or any other of his
Books, againſt our Epiſcopacy, Liturgy, or Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. So unformable was
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as well as to our Church.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot paſs by thoſe Scandalous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, with
which he defames thoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Biſhops and other Divines, with whom he
treated.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Morly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Was often there, and
with fluent words and much carneſtneſs, was the chief Speaker of all the
Biſhops, and the greateſt Interrupter of us.</hi> [This Biſhop was a
Perſon well known beyond the Seas, by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65960:79"/>againſt <hi>Militere</hi> and other Papiſts in defence of our
Religion. In his Exile, he beſt knew Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and affirms, as is
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>p.</hi> 13. of a Letter concerning him, <hi>That his furious
eagerneſs to engage in a Diſputation, to which his Brethren ſhewed
themſelves unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, did wholy fruſtrate the way, that tended to an
amicable and fair compliance;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was ſenſible
that he ſpake too much, and too boldly, and therefore might deſerve to be
interrupted by his <hi>Dioceſan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Biſhop</hi> Coſins <hi>was there conſtantly, and had a
great deal of talk with ſo little Logick, natural or artificial, that none
was moved by any thing he ſaid, but two Virtues he ſhewed; one that he was
excellently well verſed in Canons, Councils, and Fathers, which he remembred
when we tryed him; the other was, that as he was of a ruſtick Wit and
Carriage, ſo he would endure more freedom of our diſcourſe, and was more
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable than the reſt, but we took him not for a Magician.</hi> [It was no
ſign of a Ruſtick wit and carriage, that he could endure freely the
Language and Behaviour of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> with which the reſt of the
Commiſſioners were more offended. And his Two excellent Treatiſes of the
Canon of the Sacred Scripture, and Tranſubſtantiation, which were Two
ſuch Bones, as brake the Teeth of the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> and
ſtick in their Throats to this day, nor will they ever be able to digeſt
them, ſhew that he wanted neither Logick, nor any<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65960:79"/>part of
Learning becoming an excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, though he never pretended to be a
Magician; or to work ſuch wonders as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Diſciples
at <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> are reported to have done, <hi>p.</hi> 80, 81,
<hi>&amp;c. Of Mr.</hi> Baxter<hi>'s Life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Biſhop</hi> Hichman <hi>was of the moſt Grave, Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Reverend Aſpect of any of them, and of a good inſight in the Fathers and
Councils; he ſpake calmly and ſlowly, but was as high in his Principles and
Reſolutions as any.</hi> He was a Perſon of a Sedate and Chriſtian Temper
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the paſſionate and furious tranſports of Mr.
<hi>Baxter;</hi> a Perſon of ſerious deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſtant
reſolution, as fit for a Privy Councellor as any of his Order, and this which
was his ſingular Vertue, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> repreſents as his Crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Biſhop</hi> Sanderſon <hi>of</hi> Lincoln <hi>ſeldom
ſpake, but his great Learning and Worth are known by his Labours, and his
aged Peeviſhneſs not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> more than once
noted this Biſhop for a Partial and Peeviſh Old Man, but his profound
Judgment and Mature Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſuch Subjects as he conſidered,
ſuch as his Tracts <hi>De Juramento, De Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> his Volume of
Sermons, and his occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> are not to be
paralel'd by any Ancient or Modern Writer. Nor was he miſtaken when he told

that there was at the <hi>Savoy</hi> Meeting, one that appeared 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65960:80"/>ſo bold, troubleſome and illogical, as forced this

                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Sterne <hi>lookt ſo honeſtly, and gravely, and
ſoberly, that I ſcarce thought ſuch a face could deceive me; but when I
talkt of many Diſſenters in the Nation, he turn'd to the other Biſhops,
and ſaid, He will not ſay in the Kingdom, leaſt he own a King.</hi> [This
is that Perſon that is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the Authour of that excellent
Book, <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> and ſome other Works collected into a
Volume in Folio; nor did he fail in his Conjecture, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
was unwilling to own a King.</p>

his Preſence ſeemed to Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> his Words and Writings are
weighty and full of uſeful Knowledge and Learning.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Sparrow <hi>ſpake but a little; yet with a Spirit
enough for the impoſing dividing Cauſe.</hi> [That is, he was conſtant to
his Principles; a Vertue wanting in Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Walton, <hi>Bp. of</hi> Cheſter, <hi>askt me,
Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did not ſay that if our Churches had no more than bare Liberty, as
others had, without the compulſion of the Sword, that none but Drunkards
would joyn in them. I anſwered, I only ſaid that as they had been ordered,
if they had but equal liberty for Volunteers, they would<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65960:80"/>be
like Ale-houſes, where many honeſt men may come, but the number of worſe
comers is ſo great, as maketh it diſhonourable.</hi> [This Man ſet forth
the Polyglot Bible, which for its worth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Bibles ſet forth by
the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France.</hi> And what he charged on Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> he himſelf proves to be true, in declaring the Conformiſts
to be guilty of Schiſm and Perjury, which he ſays are worſe than
Drunkards.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Pierſon <hi>and Dr.</hi> Gunning <hi>did all
their work. Dr.</hi> Pierſon <hi>was their true Logician and Diſputant,
without whom, as far as I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, we ſhould have had nothing from
them. He diſputed accurately, ſoberly, and calmly, being but once in a
paſſion. He was the ſtrength and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Cauſe, which we
doubted whether he heartily maintained.</hi> [i.e.] They thought him to be an
Hypocrite or Presbyterian, but his Vindication of <hi>Ignatius</hi> hath
ſtruck Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, and others Diſcourſes againſt
Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to the very heart, ſo as noon need to ſtrike again. And his
Treatiſe on the Creed hath done the like to the Cauſe of the Atheiſts and
Socinians. But the reaſon why he ſpeaks ſo well of this Doctor, was to
raiſe his own Trophies in his conceited Victory over him.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Gunning <hi>was the forwardeſt and greateſt
Speaker, underſtanding well what belonged to a Diſputant; a Man of greater
ſtudy and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry than any of them; well read in Fathers and Councils,
and of a ready Tongue, and I hear<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65960:81"/>and believe of a very
temperate Life, as to all Carnal Exceſſes; but ſo vehement for his high
impoſing Principles, and ſo over-zealous for Arminianiſm and Formality
and Church Pomp, and ſo very eager in his Diſcourſe, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Prejudice and Paſſion much perverted his Judgment; and I am ſure they
made him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably over-run himſelf in his Diſcourſes.</hi> [The
Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> where he long and deſervingly
poſſeſſed and adorned the Chair, give him a better Character,
<hi>viz.</hi> for an accurate Diſputant and excellent Divine, as well as for
a Perſon who had a great power over his Paſſions and Appetite; but all
theſe things made againſt him; for when ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of note
interceded for him with the Committee that caſt him out of his Chair, their
Plea of his Learning and Holy Living was ſilenced by one of the Committee,
who ſaid, He was the more like to do hurt.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On our part,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, Dr.</hi> Bates
<hi>ſpake very ſolidly, judiciouſly and pertinently when he ſpake. And
for my ſelf, I thought the day and Cauſe commanded me theſe two things,
which were objected as my Crimes,</hi> viz. <hi>ſpeaking too boldly and too
long.</hi> [I ſhall only refer the Reader to <hi>p.</hi> 90. of the third
part of his Life, where to <hi>p.</hi> 98. he gives tranſcendent Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums
to his Non-conformiſt Brethren, every one almoſt hath ſome extraordinary
Praiſes for Learning and Godlineſs.]</p>
               <p>But, wherever he ſpeaks of the Conforming<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65960:81"/>Clergy, he beſtows ſome of theſe black Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters on them, That
they are proud, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, covetous, domineering, malignant, lazy, the Plague of
the World, Troublers of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Dividers of Churches, that will (being
Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites as to Chriſtianity and Godlineſs) like <hi>Judas,</hi> that
loved the Bag better than Chriſt, make themſelves a Religion conſiſting
of meer Corps and the dead Image of true Religion. See his
<hi>Prognoſtication</hi> dated (he ſays) when by the King's Commiſſion
we in vain treated for Concord 1661. <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13. of his
<hi>Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> with ſuch Prejudice, it ſeems, he came to that
Conference, which waxed ſo groſs, that he quite loſt his Faculty of
diſcerning Light from Darkneſs, or good from Evil. So that though he was
conſtrained to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the great Learning of the Biſhops with whom he
contended, yet he thought it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to blacken them all, to ſay that
they were for Conformity, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> in his ſenſe for Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and Perjury. How unfit Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was to commit to Hiſtory, either
the Relation of our late War againſt the King, or of this Debate, or of the
Primitive or Modern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſops, appears by thoſe Qualifications which he
himſelf requires to the credibility of an Hiſtorian, as in his Preface to
his <hi>Church Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(viz.) That he be
impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, a lover of peace, and not ingaged in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; a ſober, calm,
conſiderate man, not one that is paſſionately raſh, that ſhews a
malignant<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65960:82"/>ſpirit; one that extenuates or denies all the
good that was in his Adverſaries, and faſtneth on them all the Odium he can
without proof; one that is not deeply ingaged in a party; one that is of

want of which qualifications, it is truly obſerved by Dr. <hi>Maurice,</hi>
that as his Church Hiſtory was deſigned to diſgrace Dioceſan Biſhops,
ſo the Preface looks as if it were intended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace his Hiſtory. Nor
muſt we believe our Senſes, if we muſt believe that they were
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal men that begun the late War, when the contrary appears, by many
other acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Proofs and continued viſible Effects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Parliament having had long and late experience how
troubleſome and implacable ſuch as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> were, proceeded to
the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>publick Worſhip,</hi>
excluding none but ſuch as would exclude themſelves: And as a ſignal of
his Majeſty's impartial favour, he offered <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> to three,
<hi>Deanries</hi> to two or three; more and other Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities were given to
ſeveral ſober Perſons that had been of another Perſwaſion. One
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick was accepted; one (which I ſuppoſe was Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>)
refuſed it. See <hi>p.</hi> 134. of <hi>First Plea.</hi> His reaſon I
ſuppoſe was the ſame that he gave for not reading Common Prayer,
<hi>p.</hi> 105. of <hi>Sacr. Deſert. Should the Miniſters that have
ſuffered ſo long, but uſe any part of the Liturgy and Scripture Forms,
though without<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65960:82"/>any motive but the pleaſing of God, and
the Churches good,</hi> (it ſeems theſe Motives would not prevail for this
Reaſon) <hi>what muttering and cenſuring would there be againſt
them?</hi> This bold Man was afraid of the People. And in truth he has made it
morally impoſſible for him to accept a Biſhoprick, having often declared
by word, and publiſhed it in print, That <hi>the Office of a Biſhop, as
exerciſed in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>was Antichriſtian.</hi> And
ſaith in his <hi>Method for peace of Conſcience,</hi> p. 389. <hi>We had
taken down the ſuperfluous honour of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as Antichriſtian; upon
which</hi> (N.B.) <hi>the Devil ſet them to cry down alſo as
Antichriſtian, Tythes, Maintenance, Prieſts, and Miniſters:</hi> And
moreover, that <hi>the return of ſuch Men would be a great Plague to the
Land,</hi> in Poſtſer. to <hi>the True Catholick,</hi> p. 335. And Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> knows there is an ancient Canon, <hi>That a man that had his
hand in blood, might not be a Biſhop.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 213. of his
Hiſtory. And <hi>p.</hi> 36. <hi>A Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which gratifieth the Devil and
wicked Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now he begins to defame the Laws, as he had formerly done
the <hi>Liturgy:</hi> and not having other means, he diſcovers his impotent
malice in writing a Prognoſtication, <hi>dated when by the King's
Commiſſion we in vain treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Concord,</hi> 1661. He obſerved,
<hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>That the Sectarian Spirit was like Gunpowder, ready to take
fire on ſuch injuries:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with his
Prognoſtication, like <hi>Guy Faux</hi> with his<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65960:83"/>Dark
Lanthorn, is ready for the Exploit, and ſorry only that it is not done. He
intimates the Clergy to be <hi>proud, worldly, covetous, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering,
malignant, lazy, the plague of the world, troublers of Princes, dividers of
Churches, that will (being Hypocrites as to Chriſtianity and Godlineſs)
like</hi> Judas, <hi>that loved the Bag better than Chriſt, make themſelves
a Religion conſiſting of meer Corps, and the dead Image of true
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13. He cries out of <hi>New Impoſitions,
Subſcriptions, and Oaths, words and Actions which they believe to be
againſt God's Word.</hi> Doth not this aim directly at the Laws? P. 14. he
ſays, <hi>Their Sufferings will make many otherwiſe ſober Miniſters too
impatient, and to give their Tongues leave to take down the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the
Clergy: And this will ſtir up the People, and make them pray for the downfal
of the Clergy, which they take to be Enemies of God and Godlineſs; and that
to ſpeak eaſily or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of ſuch Men, is but to be lukewarm and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different between GOD AND THE DEVIL,</hi> p. 20. <hi>Some</hi> (of the
Non-conformiſt Miniſters) <hi>will think theſe Paſſions of the People
needful to check the ſierceneſs of the Afflictors: Some of the more
injudicious hot-brain'd ſort (who are the greateſt number) will put them
on, and make them believe that all Communion with any Conforming Miniſters or
Pariſh Churches is unlawful, and that they are all Temporizers, and Betrayers
of Truth and Purity, that communicate with them: and carry about among
themſelves falſe Reports<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65960:83"/>and Slanders; becauſe they
will think that the upholding of their Cauſe, which they think is God's, doth
need the ſuppreſſion of theſe mens Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Reputations,</hi> p. 25,
26. <hi>The godly and peaceable Conformiſts will get the love of the
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by their Doctrine and Lives; but will be deſpiſed by the
Sectaries, becauſe they conform; and will be ſeparated by the proud and
perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Clergy, as leaning to the Diſſenters; and thereupon will be
under continual Jealouſies and Rebukes: And perhaps new Points of Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhall be deviſed to be impoſed on them, which it is known their
Conſciences are againſt, that ſo they alſo may be forced to be
Non-conformiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſecret Enemies are more dangerous than open
Foes: and ſo part of them will turn down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Non-conformiſts, and the
other part will live in diſpleaſure till they ſee an opportunity to
ſhew it. And theſe are the likelieſt to croſs and weaken the worldly
perſecuting Clergy.</hi> This is ſuch a Prognoſtication, as that for
which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves Mr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal</hi> was condemned in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, in an <hi>Aſſize-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> on
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. And it is no otherwiſe a Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication than
(<hi>Aſtrologers</hi> obſerve of <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing-ſtars</hi>) they do
irritate and diſpoſe the Humours and Spirits of Men to diſorderly
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; to which the event ſhews that this Prognoſtication, and Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s influence on the People, hath had a malign Aſpect, not
unlike the Propheſie of <hi>Noſtredamus</hi>'s Son, That a certain great
City ſhould be burnt; and<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65960:84"/>to fulfil his Propheſie, did
procure it to be ſet on fire.</p>
               <p>My next Remark is on Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at
<hi>Kedderminſter,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> publickly
declared, That <hi>he made the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe that it was lawful for them to
take up Arms against the King, and ſuffered or made them to ſcruple at
thoſe things which were lawful, which he himſelf confeſſeth to be
lawful;</hi> and that <hi>he himſelf heard him to maintain ſuch a
Poſition as was deſtructive to the Legiſlative Power both of both of God
and Man;</hi> (viz.) <hi>That the enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things lawful by lawful
Authority, if they might by accident be the cauſe of ſin, was
ſinful.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This was the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Argument urged
againſt Kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                  </note> See the
Biſhops Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 4. and 6. Now though the known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the
Biſhop is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make all good Men believe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yet the
conſideration of the Premiſes puts the truth of it beyond all doubt or
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Was this behaviour of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s a token of his
Gratitude to thoſe Biſhops who gave him licenſe to preach in their
Dioceſs; or to his Subſcription to the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (then
<hi>Shelden</hi>) to thoſe terms of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs which the Biſhop
accepted, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> voluntarily ſubſcribed? <hi>p.</hi> 12.
of his late <hi>Apology.</hi> If ever he did any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Publick Peace,
he was drawn to it <hi>in vitâ Minervâ,</hi> and ſoon retracted
it; but to promote Diviſions he laboured <hi>manibus pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſque,</hi> with
all his ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65960:84"/>His Book called <hi>The Cure of Church
Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> is the only Work of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that hath any thing
of Moderation; and yet as if he were ſorry for what he had done, at Mr.
<hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi>'s Exceptions againſt he, he ſays, <hi>Doth it not
ſpeak against Church Tyranny, unjust Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Violence, and taking
away Men's Liberties, and Rigour to Diſſenters, from end to end?</hi> p. 7.
of his Defence. It ſeems it was expected of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that he
ſhould have called the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops <hi>Sacrilegious Silencers of the faithful
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Murderers of many hundred thouſand Souls, perjurious, proud,
tyrannical, covetous, formal Hypocrites, malignant haters of good Men,</hi> and
then he had not incurred the blame of the People, <hi>p.</hi> 20. And to regain
their good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him, he hath ſince ſaid all this again and again.
Another part of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter appears in what was done about
the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; which by a Book called <hi>The peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Deſign,</hi>
agreeing well with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> ſeems to
have been procur'd by the joynt Endeavours of the Papiſts, and thoſe that
call themſelves Proteſtant Diſſenters; in which Book, <hi>p.</hi> 71.
is this Objection: <hi>What ſhall we ſay then to the Papiſts?</hi>
Anſw. <hi>The Papist in our account is but one ſort of Recuſants, and the
conſcientious and peaceable among them, muſt be held in the ſame
predicament with thoſe among our ſelves, that likewiſe refuſe to come
to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 72. <hi>As for the common Papiſt, who
lives innocently in his way, he is to us<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65960:85"/>as other
Separatiſts, and ſo comes under the like toleration.</hi> So that
<hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> are confederate againſt Chriſt.
But Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> muſt lead the Chorus here alſo; for he much
exceeds the Author of that Treatiſe, in his good opinion of the Papiſts:
yet he ſays, <hi>Mr.</hi> Humphry <hi>is a man of latitude, and tyeth
himſelf to no Party or Opinions of other men; And I</hi> (ſaith Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>ſo little fear the noiſe of the Cenſorious, that
even now while the Plot doth render them most odious, ſay freely,</hi> 1.
<hi>That I would have Papiſts uſed like men: And,</hi> 2. <hi>I would have
no man put to death for being a Priest:</hi> 3. <hi>I would have no Writ</hi>
de Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicato capiendo, <hi>or any Law compel them to our Communion and
Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not this to open the door for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Fanaticks to
enter together? If the Laws, how ſevere ſoever, cannot keep them out, would
not this Liberty bring them in? See <hi>p.</hi> 19. of <hi>Second Defence.</hi>
If you will not bring the Papiſts in, he is reſolved, for ought I ſee, to
go to them: for <hi>p.</hi> 235. of <hi>Firſt Plea,</hi> he ſays, <hi>It is
but reaſonable if on ſuch neceſſity</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Penalties
for Nonconformity) <hi>they ſhould accept of favour from any Papiſt that
ſhould ſave them,</hi> &amp;c. By which the Reader may judge, who is a
greater Friend to Popery, the <hi>old Proteſtants,</hi> who have made Laws to
keep it out; or the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who would deſtroy thoſe Laws
to let it in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:65960:85"/>To put life into the languiſhing Cauſe,
he inſpires it with a Doſe called <hi>Sacrilegious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the
Miniſtry rebuked;</hi> and declares, That <hi>as they had preached formerly
without leave, ſo they would do it much more now;</hi> and ſays, <hi>That
though it had cost ſome excellent men their lives, yet nothing but death, or
utter diſable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould make them deſiſt.</hi> So that his
<hi>Pleas</hi> and his <hi>Practice</hi> before and ſince the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
ſhew that he owned the King no great thanks for it: Yet being adviſed by a
moderate hand not to abuſe that Indulgence, he rails at him moſt
intolerably; (you ſhall hear it by and by:) I will only ask Mr.
<hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> why the neglect to adminiſter the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments was not
as much <hi>Sacrilegious Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miniſtry</hi> (whereof it is a
chief Work) as the omiſſion of preaching? For Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
confeſſeth, <hi>That he had not baptized any, nor adminiſtred the Lord's
Supper, for eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or nineteen years together; nor adhered to any Sect</hi>
(no not the <hi>Sect</hi> of Dioceſan Biſhops) <hi>for twenty five
years.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 119. of Anſw. to Dr. <hi>Hinkley:</hi> Which to
me ſeems to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Deſertion</hi> of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi>
but of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> it ſelf. Certainly if he ought to do the one,
he ought not to leave the other undone. <hi>That he and others are Paſtors to
no Church, that he never gathered a Church, nor hath he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned in
Communion with any Church,</hi> Anſw. to the Bp. of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s
Serm. <hi>p.</hi> 64. 24. 62. 86. Yet <hi>p.</hi> 76. of his Book of
<hi>Concord,</hi> he ſays, <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65960:86"/>joyn with
my Pariſh Church in Liturgy and Sacraments, and hope ſo to do while I
live.</hi> But if he thought it his duty to <hi>preach,</hi> it was his duty to
<hi>adminiſter the Sacraments</hi> alſo; for preaching was never eſteemed
the ſole Work of the Miniſters: And they that omit this Duty, to refuſe
to hear the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church of Christ,</hi> as well as the <hi>Church
of</hi> England: For by Canon. Apoſt. the 9th, <hi>Whoever of the Faithful
enter and hear the Sacred Scriptures, but ſtay not at Prayers and Communion,
ought to be excommunicated as Diſturbers of the Church.</hi> All Churches in
the Primitive times did on <hi>every Sunday</hi> celebrate this Holy Sacrament;
and all the faithful were wont to receive it. It is alſo very obſervable,
that when our Church was to be ſetled, that ſome of the Presbyterians moved
to have the Rubrick ſtruck out which obligeth the People to Communicate three
times yearly; whereas ſome modern Churches have found it neceſſary to
declare as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Agatho</hi> did, (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>

the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry doth not ſave Men, as Wizards think that Charms do heal Men
by their preſence, titles, names, or habits, by ſtanding in the
Reading-place or Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, or being called the Parſon of the Pariſh, or

believe all this.) P. 10. <hi>They ſuppoſe that a greater number of the
confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Prieſts than they are willing to mention, do preach ſo
ignorantly and dully in the Pulpits, and do ſo little of their private work
beſides, that there is great need of a far greater number of Aſſiſtants
than all the preſent Non-conformiſts be. They are not able to confute the
People, who tell them that their publick Prieſts are ſo defective in their
neceſſary qualifications for their Office, as that they hold it unlawful to
own ſuch for true Miniſters, and encourage them by their preſence, or
commit the care of their Souls to ſuch.</hi> P. 11. <hi>They think that the
ejecting</hi> (the Non-conformiſts) <hi>from the Temples and Tythes did not
degrade nor make them no true Paſtors to their Flocks; and that the
Magiſtrates putting another Pariſh Miniſter in poſſeſſion of the
Temple and Tythes, did not diſſolve the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid relation. They think
that the ejected Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> foro Conſcientiae &amp; Eccleſiae vere

of them ſchiſmatically ſeparate from him, and joyn with another Intruder

great Pride, Malice, and Obloquy, on ſo ſlender occaſion as the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, prepared by the means, and in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Papiſts as well as
the Presbyter. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knew the Perſon againſt whom he wrote to
be a Perſon of <hi>Great Learning and Moderation,</hi> as he had acknowledged
under his own hand in his Book of <hi>Conformation,</hi> where he often quotes

Plot of the Papiſts to Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the King (whom God hath hitherto
by a ſeries of Miracles preſerved) and the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
againſt which the Gates of Hell have not, and we hope never ſhall prevail, 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65960:88"/>was diſcovered, to the great joy of all true
Proteſtants. And now while they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Foundations, Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> (though a dying Man) lifts up himſelf, and gets on the top of
the Fabrick, to throw it down with all his might. This Polity he learnt of his
Predeceſſors, who on the intended <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> 88. and the
<hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon,</hi> when the Papiſts thought to have
<hi>ſwallowed us up quick,</hi> took their advantage to thruſt us into
their Jaws, or at leaſt to devour us themſelves, if we ſhould eſcape
our other Adverſaries. That he might act with leſs ſuſpition, and more
ſucceſs, he calls his Engines <hi>A Plea for Peace,</hi> which, as Biſhop
<hi>Stillingfleet</hi> obſerves, might be better called, <hi>A Plea for
Diſcord and Diviſion;</hi> And another called, <hi>The true and only way of
Concord; ſo full fraught with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable Notions, and dividing
Principles, as if his whole deſign had been to prove, that there is no true
way of Concord among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Biſhop</hi> Stillingfleet. But of this
Book hereafter: Another Book claims precedency, whereof after great labour Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but it proved a Monſter full of Teeth and
Claws, which he calls <hi>Church-Hiſtory of the Government of Biſhops;</hi>
but is indeed (though very partial) a Hiſtory of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions which
were raiſed in the Church by ſuch as oppoſed the Orthodox Biſhops. That
the ſight of this Monſtrous Birth may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, let the Reader fortifie
his Eye-ſight<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65960:89"/>with what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf
hath prepared: For, telling us <hi>what Hiſtory is credible,</hi> p. 2. n. 4.
of that Tract, <hi>It ought to be,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of One that is
impartial, a lover of Peace and not ingaged by Faction or Interest to one
ſide againſt the other; a calm and conſiderate Man, not a paſſionate
haſty Judge; a Man of manifeſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, Conſcience, and Fear of God;
not a Worldly, Wicked, Bloody, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconſcionable Man.</hi> Now let the Reader
conſider whether this Character agree with our Author: And then let the
Reader take that other Antidote in the Preface—<hi>The Sectaries,</hi>
ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, who raſhly ſeparate from ſome Churches, becauſe
of ſome Forms, Opinions, or Ceremonies, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Chriſtians on
Earth have uſed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purer Ages, and ſtill uſe, ſhould be
more cautelous in examining their grounds, and ſhould hardly venture to
ſeparate from any Church, for that which for the ſame reaſon would move
them to ſeparate from almost all Chriſtians in the whole World, if not
unchurch the Church of Chriſt.</hi> And let the Reader ſatisfie himſelf,
whether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Model</hi> be not ſuch a Form. And may it
not be ſaid of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as he ſays of Dr. <hi>Heylin? He is
ſo palpably partial, and of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and bloody a ſtrain,
repreſenting excellent perſons as odious intolerable Rogues, that he is not
to be believed?</hi> Judge by this one paſſage, <hi>p.</hi> 120. <hi>If our
Neighbours, that commonly theſe Thirty Years laſt uſe the word</hi> God
dam me, <hi>had put but</hi> thee <hi>inſtead of</hi> me, <hi>I ſhould have
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65960:89"/>ſuſpected that the Councils and Biſhops had made
their Religion.</hi> To which add, <hi>p.</hi> 464. <hi>Have not the
Miniſters themſelves been the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of taking down the
Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>And what have they got by it?</hi> I doubt not but
the Reader will find the whole Collection to be a Hiſtory of the Confuſion
and Bloodſhed occaſioned by diſcontented and ambitious Presbyters and
their party, againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, who ſuffered under Heathen
<hi>Arian,</hi> and other heretical Emperours, by Popes, Hereticks, and
Schiſmaticks, miſapplied all to the Biſhops and Councils; and often
ſpeaks more favourably of Hereticks, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Arius,</hi> the
<hi>Novatians,</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who though they were uſurping
Presbyters, he calls them Biſhops; and through their ſides ſtrikes at the
Sacred Office, <hi>p.</hi> 276. of his <hi>Plea for Peace; It was by Biſhops
ſtriving who ſhould be Chief, that the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>ſet up:</hi>
Whereas the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> were diſcontented Presbyters. <hi>And in
the Schiſms of thoſe times, the Biſhops were</hi> almoſt <hi>ever the
chief Cauſe.</hi> The <hi>Almoſt</hi> will not ſave it from a Lye. But
evident it is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quarrel there was in all Church-Hiſtory, wherein a
Biſhop was concerned, how Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, how Orthodox ſoever, Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> makes him the cauſe of the Quarrel, and is his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.
Hereof I could give many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> prevented
me, having ſaid and done enough to overthrow the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his Hiſtory.
However, I will ſhew the<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65960:90"/>Reader a <hi>Specimen</hi> of
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Candour and Truth in relating Church-Hiſtory. Doth not
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> know (however he diſſembles it) that <hi>Arius</hi> and
<hi>Aërius, Novatus</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian, Majorinus</hi> Chaplain to
<hi>Lucilla</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Woman, with <hi>Botruus,</hi> and
<hi>Sileſius,</hi> who firſt oppoſed <hi>Cecilian</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſet up for Biſhops by the help of <hi>Donatus,</hi>
who ſucceeded them, and gave name to the Schiſm, were all Presbyters? Till
they dub'd one another Biſhops, and then with whole Armies oppoſed their
lawful Biſhops, who with great patience and conſtancy withſtood their
malice. Read the Hiſtory of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> lately ſet forth, and
ſee how they uſed St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelf. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
may as well aſcribe all the Rebellion and Outrages, all the Blaſphemies and
Faction that have been made within Forty Years paſt, to the Biſhops of this
Land, whereto (it's well known) the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> opened the way, and
led the dance, as to impute what he doth to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Biſhops; and indeed
he is not aſhamed to aſſert both theſe notorious falſhoods. Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> asks the Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 429. of his <hi>Cure of
Diviſions; Who brought in the errours of the</hi> Arians, Eunomians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he Anſwers, <hi>They were Biſhops or Presbyters:</hi>
He would be ſure to ſpeak one true word. I ſhall not trouble the Reader
with all that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> writes of the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians,</hi>
&amp;c. in that voluminous Book, but refer him to what he<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65960:90"/>ſays more briefly in his other late Works; for he repeats it in many
of them. P. 27. of his <hi>Plea,</hi> He <hi>would not have the</hi> Arian
<hi>Emperours made worſe than they were, becauſe they were for Toleration
of both Parties; nor were the</hi> Arians <hi>themſelves like the</hi>
Socinians (ſaith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they acknowledged all ſave the

               <p>In the Diſpute between St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and

<hi>Mother of God,</hi> you may ſee how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially he deſcribes both the
Perſons and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, <hi>p.</hi> 271. of his <hi>Plea: Neſtorius</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>was a Man of Study and Retirement, a poor garb, and a strict
life,</hi> (i.e. a <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) <hi>abhorring publick Contentions,
and loving Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, till he got to be uppermoſt; and then he ſhewed a
peeviſh Zeal againſt Diſſenters, called Hereticks.</hi> Then for St.
<hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whoſe Works praiſe him in all the
Churches,<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65960:91"/>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſcarce a good word for
him, becauſe he was the firſt Biſhop that uſed the Sword, and
perſecuted the Diſſenters: <hi>He was a Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of
great Parts, Spirit, and Power; but the Head of a Turbulent Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As to
their Opinions, the Errour of the</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians <hi>lay in his want of
skill in ſpeaking,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, and the Controverſie was
about words rather than matter. Moſt of the People were for</hi> Neſtorius,
<hi>and moſt of the Courtiers and Clergy against him; and ſo was the
Emperour, who depoſed</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>and reſtored</hi> Cyril:
<hi>but</hi> Neſtorius <hi>returned to his Monaſtery, and there lived four
Years in Peace and great Reputation; but afterwards was Baniſhed into Foreign
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and died.</hi> I wonder why after Four Years he ſhould be
Baniſhed, if he had lived peaceably and quietly. Did not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
ever read how the Emperour <hi>Theodotius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Decrees of the
Third General Council at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> commanding, <hi>That none ſhould
dare to keep, read, or tranſcribe the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Books of the profane and
ſacrilegious</hi> Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, <hi>but ſearch them out, cauſe them to be
burnt publickly; and that none permit them to have any Houſe or Field to hold
private or publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; and whoever adhered to</hi> Neſtorius,
<hi>ſhould ſuffer the loſs of his Goods? By which Edict</hi> (ſaith the
Perfect) <hi>our pious Emperour knowing the Orthodox Religion to be the
ſtrength of the Empire, hath taken away all the ſeeds of Impiety.</hi>
Edictum Theodoſii in fine<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65960:91"/>Concilii. I ſee no reaſon
why Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould ſpeak ſo favourably of
<hi>Neſtorius,</hi> though I have conſidered all that he writes, but that
he might make his Readers think more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible of <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was
ſo great, learned, and good a Biſhop. <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> an
approved Author, who lived near that time, writes thus: <hi>Infelix ille</hi>

Epiſt. 4. ad Cornel. For indeed <hi>Novation</hi> was an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<hi>Presbyter</hi> that contended againſt <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> to thruſt him
out of his Chair, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe to his Communion who in the time of
Perſecution under <hi>Decius</hi> had denied the Faith, ſuppoſing that
they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent after ſuch a fall. In oppoſition to ſuch, he calls
his Faction the <hi>Cathari</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows how to
Engliſh.) This pure <hi>Presbyter</hi> ſent for three <hi>Ruſtick
Biſhops,</hi> as my Author calls them, from <hi>Italy,</hi> to come to him at
<hi>Rome,</hi> under pretence of mediating for him with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and
the other Biſhops. Being come he entertains them with plenty of good Chear
and Wine (which is ſtill in faſhion with that ſort of People;) and when
they had well drank, ſome of his Party force the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65960:92"/>to lay their hands on <hi>Novatian,</hi> and make him an
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> Biſhop: for it will puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to name
his Title, though he call him <hi>an ill choſen Biſhop of</hi> Rome; which
Title he gives him, only to draw an Odium on the Biſhops, though the great
troubles brought upon the Church by their Errours and Schiſms, were wholly
the fruit of their Envy againſt <hi>Cornelius</hi> the lawful Biſhop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> Of which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo gives a full account, who
cauſed the meeting of ſome Councils to ſuppreſs them. Yet Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> (ſuch is his Zeal for Anti-Prelatical Men) thus excuſeth
the matter: <hi>It was Zeal againſt Errour, which made both the</hi>
Novatians <hi>and the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>run into Errour,</hi> p. 32. And
though that long and ſad Schiſms did enſue, yet he thus excuſeth it:
<hi>The Rigour of the</hi> Novatians <hi>was increaſed by their offence at
other mens ſinful latitude and tepidity,</hi> p. 35.</p>

<hi>Nice,</hi> and the Hereſie of <hi>Arius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 45. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>That</hi> Athanaſius
<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to admit</hi> Arius <hi>to his Communion, cauſed much
Calamities:</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 46. <hi>They that had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Separate
Churches, did communicate with</hi> Arius <hi>that they might be delivered from
the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of a godly Biſhop, (i.e.)</hi> from
<hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſeth to be <hi>a
godly Biſhop:</hi> but being <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and oppoſing the <hi>Arian
Conventicles,</hi> he is a Perſecutor. That you may ſee the Partiality of
this Hiſtorian,<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65960:93"/>I ſhall give you a brief Hiſtory of
the growth of <hi>Arianiſm. Arius</hi> a Presbyter, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the
firſt General Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> for denying the Deity of Chriſt,
making him a Creature; for which he was baniſhed by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
as the cauſe of great Diviſion and Corruption in the Church. But there was
a certain Presbyter who grew into ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with
<hi>Conſtantia</hi> the Emperours Siſter, as to perſwade her that
<hi>Arius</hi> had been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Council, and did not hold the
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for which he was condemned: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> recals
<hi>Arius,</hi> and enquires into the truth of that report; and
<hi>Conſtantia</hi> dying, recommends this Presbyter to the Emperour her
Brother, as worthy of his favour; and when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> died, this
Presbyter carrieth the News to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> that his Father had
bequeathed the Eaſtern Empire to him: Which being what he hoped for, he
received the Presbyter into his Favour, and kept him in his Court; where
firſt he infected ſome of the Eunuchs with that Errour, and by their means
the Empreſs alſo, and ſo the Emperour himſelf. <hi>Socrates</hi> l.
1.19. and l. 2.2. This revived the <hi>Arian</hi> Faction: <hi>Arius</hi> is
reſtored to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from whence the multitude of his Followers
having conſpired the death of <hi>Athanaſius, Conſtantine</hi> had
removed <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> into <hi>Gallia,</hi> where <hi>Conſtans</hi>
his Son then lived, who entertained him with ſome reſpect; and writes to
his Brother <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to admit<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65960:93"/>him again to
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> or threatneth him with War, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi>
18. Whereupon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> is reſtored, but his life is in
perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual danger, the <hi>Arians</hi> being more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than the Orthodox.
<hi>Hoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba,</hi> a Man of great Age and
Learning, and a conſtant Aſſertor of the Truth, was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully whipped
and tortured by them, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. And though they were
condemned by the Councils of <hi>Milain</hi> and <hi>Ariminum,
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> favours them, and threatneth the Councils. To him
ſucceeded <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, then <hi>Jovianus,</hi> who
reigned but Seven Months; then <hi>Valentian,</hi> who admitted
<hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> to partake of the Empire: All which time
the <hi>Arians</hi> exerciſed great cruelty not only on the Orthodox
Biſhops, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other; for under them ſprang up the
<hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Eunomians,</hi> lib. 4. cap. 23. and <hi>lib.</hi>

<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> lib. 7. cap. 20. vexed the <hi>Novatians</hi> and

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tria Capitula</hi> were three Chapters men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the
Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in which the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who could
not longer defend their Hereſie under the Name of its Author, ſought to
cloke it under the Name and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Mopſueſtia;</hi> of <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Writings againſt St.
<hi>Cyril;</hi> and an Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas</hi> unto <hi>Maris.</hi> Theſe
made the <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi> for which Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> and ſome of
his Party appeared: But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and the Catholick
Biſhops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt them. Many Sectaries who were condemned under the
name of the <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phali,</hi> diſclaimed this Council; others preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it
had approved of the <hi>Tria Capitula.</hi> Great Diviſions enſued
hereupon. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> knowing that the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>
had exploded that Hereſie, ſends forth his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Edict, wherein
accurſing the Authors and Abettors of thoſe <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi> he
ſummons the Fifth General Council of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> at which the
Pope refuſed to be preſent; <hi>noluit intereſſe,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and the true reaſon was, becauſe he favoured that
Hereſie, and approved not of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which was
held without him, and did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for the Prerogative of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65960:94"/>him.
<hi>Vigilius,</hi> though he came not himſelf, ſent his Decree which
maintained that Hereſie, and was confuted in the Sixth Collation of the
Council of <hi>Conſtans.</hi> And they ſet forth a moſt holy
Confeſſion of their Faith, conſonant in all points to that which the Holy
Apoſtles preached; which the four former Councils explained, and the holy
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with uniform conſent maintained.</p>
               <p>Now I would deſire Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve me,
whether the blame of thoſe Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which followed on this Diſſention,
is to be laid on the Emperour and the Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops who ſided with him
in defence of the true Faith, againſt Neſtorianiſm, as <hi>Binius</hi>
and <hi>Baronius</hi> would have it; or on the Pope and his <hi>Italians,</hi>
who pleaded for that Hereſie; and together with the <hi>Agnoites, Gainaites,
The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſians, Themiſtians,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phali,</hi>
promoted and continued thoſe Broils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. Conſiſting of about Sixty Pages, is
ſpent about the Worſhipping of Images, whereof he makes the Biſhops
Patrons: Whereas many, both Emperours and Biſhops, ſuffered very much as
<hi>Iconoclaſtes. (i.e.)</hi> the deſtroyers of Images. Biſhop
<hi>Jewel</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſhew but one
Authority, during Six hundred Years of the Church, for worſhipping Images,
and is not yet anſwered. The riſe of which in brief, was this: The
<hi>Arcans</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> having wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Church, made way
for vaſt numbers<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65960:95"/>of Infidels to enter in, who brought
with them, and ſuperſtitiouſly honoured the Images of their Benefactors;
and many ignorant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians learned their cuſtoms: The Pictures of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> we read of in Ancient Hiſtory; but
withal we read they were not permitted to be brought into the Churches. The
oppoſition made againſt them, may be ſeen in the <hi>Magdeburg.</hi> In
the year 754 the Biſhops diſputed againſt them, and in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> conſiſting of 338 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. How <hi>Leo
Iſauricus</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Neocaeſaria</hi>
oppoſed them, is too large to repeat. It was about the year 787, that
<hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> who was Daughter to a Pagan King of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> gave
publick countenance to Image-worſhip. She ruling as Empreſs in the
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> her Son, promoted this Pagan cuſtom: for,
as Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> obſerves, <hi>Dux femina facti,</hi> ſhe was a Woman
of ſo Tyrannous a Spirit, that ſhe cauſed the eyes of her Son
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be put out; which ſtruck a great awe into the
Chriſtians under her. One cauſe of her Cruelty to her Son, being his
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this Image-worſhip. But finding one <hi>Taraſius</hi> to be of
her mind, ſhe makes him Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and calls a
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Nice</hi> conſiſting of 350 Biſhops, moſt of them
<hi>Arians;</hi> and ſo about the year 787, they Decreed for Image-worſhip.
But in the year 792, all was reverſed by <hi>Charles the Great</hi> in a
Council at <hi>Frankfort.</hi> One Decree<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65960:95"/>mentioned by Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> I ſhall remind him of; it is <hi>p.</hi> 213. <hi>A man that
had his hands in blood, must not be a Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Hereſie which makes the Church Hiſtory to ſwell,
is that of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks,
<hi>ch.</hi> 8. And becauſe he ſaith nothing of the riſe of it, I
ſhall. It was occaſioned by one <hi>John Philoponus</hi> a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
who wrote ſubtilly concerning it, and drew many to his Opinion, <hi>Anno</hi>
517. but all the time that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was Emperour, they hid
themſelves, and propagated their Hereſie in Conventicles; for it was
condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by 175 Biſhops, in the fifth Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
and confuted by the Learned Biſhop <hi>Gregory Nazianzene,</hi> and by 603
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the fourth General Council at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> and in the
ſixth Synod of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> by 170 Biſhops. But after the
death of <hi>Theodoſius, Philippicus</hi> ſucceeded, of whoſe
Succeſſion a <hi>Monotholite</hi> Monk had foretold him; and that if he
would reſcind the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the ſixth Synod, and favour the
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites,</hi> he ſhould raign long and happily. This made
<hi>Philippicus</hi> to eſpouſe that Cauſe; and preſently he
baniſheth <hi>Cyrus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and many
Orthodox Biſhops: He maketh one <hi>John</hi> a Presbyter Patriarch, and
filleth up the vacant Biſhopricks with Presbyters of that Faction; and then
aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, and confirms that Hereſie. But the Biſhops of the
Weſtern Churches reſiſted<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65960:96"/>it, and ſent thundering
Letters againſt it. And it is no wonder that the Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops did hide
themſelves under this Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or that <hi>Philippicus</hi> found Presbyters
to make Biſhops in their room, who defended him and the Faction: For it is
well known how many ſuch in our Age adhered to uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Powers, and
defended as great both State and Eccleſiaſtical Hereſies, as this of the
<hi>Monothelites,</hi> and would not permit the Biſhops to appear. But if
theſe Presbyters had taken the name of Biſhops under <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> as
the <hi>Monothelites</hi> did under <hi>Philippicus,</hi> you might with as
much truth have affirmed, that innumerable Biſhops did in the times of our
Confuſions defend Rebellion and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as, that the Biſhops who
ſuffered all manner of indignities from the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> did defend
that Errour, or raiſe thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults. This <hi>Philippicus</hi> within a
year and half was deprived of the Empire by the ſame Souldiers that ſet him
up; who put out his Eyes, and left him to die in Priſon as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Theſe
inſtances (for I remember that I am writing a Character of Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> and not of the ancient Hereticks) may ſuffice to acquaint
the Reader of the ingenuity of this Man, who rails intolerably againſt others
as corrupters of Hiſtory, when it appears he had no other deſign in this
Collection, but to ſerve his Hypotheſis, and implacable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt
the Biſhops, and inrage the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65960:96"/>to ſet the Nation
in a Flame. It is but a ſmall matter for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to ſupport
himſelf in Church Hiſtory: He can bid open defiance to the Laws of the
Land, which he calls <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Engines, and Enemies to God's publick
Worſhip, and ought to be diſobeyed, becauſe it is written,</hi> Whether
it be better to obey God or Man, judge ye.</p>
               <p>He begins with a modeſt complaint, <hi>p.</hi> 101. of
<hi>first Plea; It is not the ſence of the Liturgy</hi> (in that they ſeem
ſatisfied) <hi>but a Statute of Parliament which we doubt of: it ſeems
inſufficient, if not impertinent, to tell us what is taken for the ſence of
the Church; for the doubt is, what is the ſence of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we
cannot otherwiſe know, but by their plain words, till they will otherwiſe
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their meaning:</hi> (i.e.) They muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a meaning contrary to
their plain words. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks plain enough, <hi>Plea the
firſt,</hi> That <hi>the Laws required of them ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
Covenants, Declarations and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they durst not do, becauſe they
feared God.</hi> A ſtrange Parliament, to make ſo many Laws as a Man that
feareth God cannot obey! If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had any Fear or Reverence of
Men, he would not thus Reproach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and Defame their Laws, and all
the while cry out of Perſecution. But what are thoſe impious Laws? This you
find in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book called, <hi>A ſearch for the Engliſh
Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick;</hi> where he ſtates the Caſe between the 
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65960:97"/>
                  <hi>Dioceſan Canoneers,</hi> and the preſent <hi>meer
Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists;</hi> and <hi>though he determine not</hi> (as he ſays)
<hi>which of them is the Schiſmatick, yet he makes the Book to be a pair of
Spectacles for the Purblind to diſcern it,</hi> p. 43. This is juſt as he
dealt by his <hi>first Plea,</hi> where he tells us he will not urge the
Caſe, but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Matters of Fact only: Yet in his Book <hi>of Concord,</hi>
he ſays, <hi>To anſwer the earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Reaſons</hi> (againſt
Conformity) <hi>by you the Lord Biſhop of</hi> Ely, <hi>I have publiſhed an
Hiſtorical Narration,</hi> &amp;c. How did this anſwer the Biſhop's
earneſt demand of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if it did not contain them, when Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays that was the end of publiſhing that Book? Any one that
uſeth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles</hi> may ſee they were his
Reaſons, though he might well be aſhamed to call them ſo. But as for
thoſe <hi>Spectacles</hi> that will ſo plainly diſcover the <hi>Engliſh
Schiſmaticks,</hi> a very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Artiſt hath turned into a
<hi>Looking-glaſs,</hi> which if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be not afraid to make
uſe of, he may thereby ſee him whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſearch for: it is

upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ſhortly and for ever.</hi> The words are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, like the old
Oracles, and may be interpreted <hi>pro captu Lectoris,</hi> but whether he
means the Revolutions of Providence, as by the turning of the Wheel ſeems
moſt proper, or the Divine Judgment at laſt, it ſavours of equal Pride,
Malice, and Uncharitableneſs. In Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi>'s Funeral Sermon,
<hi>p.</hi> 33. preacht by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he ſpeaks more plain: <hi>It
ſeems</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is ſome great evil to come, when God
takes away the best:</hi> yea, <hi>if it ſhould be a fore-runner of a better
ſtate, yet all ſave two of the old ſtock that diſhonoured God
periſhed: And it was by bloody Wars that</hi> Joſhua <hi>and the new
GENERATION were to poſſeſs the Land of Promiſe.</hi> But the Oracle is
expounded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cabaliſtical Rabbies, who tell us boldly, <hi>the time of
the Epiſcopal Perſecution is but ſhort:</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:65960:98"/>And on
that confidence invite thoſe whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls the
<hi>paſſive Conformiſts,</hi> to come over to them, promiſing them a
kinder entertainment than they have had from their Brethren of the Conformity:
<hi>Spes eſt fore ut Fanatici quos vocant, utamur illis aequioribus,</hi>
ſaith the <hi>Celeuſma,</hi> p. 34. <hi>There is now good hope that we whom
they call</hi> Fanaticks, <hi>may ſhew them more favour.</hi> Now whether
theſe Men be not engaged in ſome Plot for the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
Eccleſiaſtical Government by Law eſtabliſhed, to which end they ſo
importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately plead for the Obligation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, let the Reader judge.
Time may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what an ingenious Man hints in his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the
Biſhop of</hi> Worceſter, p. 68. <hi>I will tell Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>a
Secret which I have heard, but hope he will not put me to prove it, That the
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made good Laws, the Papiſts out of a pretended reverence to
tender Conſciences, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Execution of them, and ſome leading
Fanaticks had private Encouragement (to ſay no more) to ſet up a mighty cry
of Perſecution, to cast all the odium on a perſecuting Church and
Dioceſan Canoneers.</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> noſes this hint: <hi>Some have
reported</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that ſome of the Non-conformiſts at least do
receive, or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Money from the Papiſts to act their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and
promote their interest; which he</hi> (very angrily) <hi>calls, a putrid
Calumny, a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Falſhood, a frontleſs Lye:</hi> and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>he avows, that never any Perſon in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <pb n="154" facs="tcp:65960:99"/>Dignity, or Power in the Nation, or any that had any relation to
Publick Affairs, nor from them, Papist or Proteſtant, did once ſpeak one
word to him, or adviſe with him about any Indulgence or Toleration to be
granted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi> He ſays not that he never received any Money
to promote a general Toleration, which he (thinking himſelf particularly
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on) might have done in few words. And my Author deſires Dr.
<hi>O.</hi> to reſolve him, <hi>Why a Fast was appointed by a certain
Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Paſtor at that time on the fifth of</hi> Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>which</hi> (as he notes) <hi>is no Popiſh Feſtival.</hi> 'Tis a
miſerable ſhift which the Doctor uſeth, ſpeaking at large of the
<hi>plain, open, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Evidence which the Non-conformiſts always
gave, and continue to give, of their faithful cordial adherence to the
Proteſtant Religion and Interest in the Nation;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ever ſince
Forty one, they have notoriouſly ſcandalized, and as much as in them lay,
ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the Proteſtant Religion and National Intereſt.</p>
               <p>His dealing with Mr. <hi>Cheney</hi> is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian;
for in the Preface of his <hi>third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> he <hi>judgeth him a godly
ſerious Man; yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>his Book is ſo diſmal a piece in
its extraordinary privation of common Reaſon, Truth, Charity, Tenderneſs,
and Modeſty, that I am conſtrained to think that honest Man is
diſeaſedly Melancholy:</hi> and reports, <hi>that his Book is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65960:99"/>ſhameleſs lyes,</hi> p. 2. of Second Part. Yet if a
ſober Reader be admitted to judge, this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Man hath ſo provoked
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s choler, that he ſeems quite to have loſt his
Reaſon, and betakes himſelf to Railing. One Argument Mr. <hi>Cheney</hi>
may well boaſt of, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls his <hi>Catholicon,</hi>
concerning a confident Tenet of Mr. <hi>Baxter, That the Acts for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity
and Prefaces are parts of the Book of Common Prayer, to which we are to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our Aſſent,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is ſaid in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face concerning
the Service of the Church, <hi>That foraſmuch as nothing can be ſo plainly
ſet forth, but doubts may ariſe in the uſe and practice of the ſame; to
appeaſe all ſuch diverſity, if any ariſe, and for the reſolution of
all doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner how to underſtand, do, and execute the
things contained in this Book, the parties that ſo doubt, or diverſly take
any thing,</hi> (as do now the Conformiſts and Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts; for Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>they could do and declare as the Conformiſts do,
if they could get the ſence of the Acts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be expounded
ſo as the Conformiſts underſtand them</hi>) (N.B.) <hi>ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
reſort to the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, who by his diſcretion ſhall take
order for the quieting and appeaſing of the ſame; ſo that the ſame
Order be not contrary to any thing contained in this Book: And if the Biſhop
of the Dioceſs be in doubt, then he may ſend for the Reſolution of the
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> anſwers, <hi>That the words make not
the Biſhops Expoſitors of the Law or Book, as<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65960:100"/>Judge,
but as a Teacher only.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cheney</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>Any intelligent
Man may help the ignorant to underſtand the things in the Book; but the
Biſhops are made deciſive Judges, to order in what manner to underſtand,
do, and execute all (doubtful) things in the Book,</hi> p. 212. And <hi>p.</hi>
213. he tells Mr. <hi>Baxter, The late Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had not ſuch Security for
their Conſciences, in taking that Oath in a ſenſe varying from the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Letter, as the Conformiſts have for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,</hi>
&amp;c. And thus the melancholy Man beat the Conjurer out of his Circle, and in
his <hi>third Defence</hi> he takes no notice of it.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> how contemptibly doth he ſpeak of
him, <hi>p.</hi> 74. ſaying, That <hi>a long tedious Diſcourſe in him
hath as much ſubſtance as one might put into a Syllogiſm of ſix
Lines.</hi> And in his Preface to the Anſwer of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of
<hi>Worceſter, I am,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter, past doubt, that</hi>
Richard Hooker, <hi>Bp.</hi> Hall, <hi>Bp.</hi> Uſher, <hi>were they now
alive, would be Non-conformiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1681. comes forth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Apology
for the Non-conformiſt Miniſters,</hi> in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of their
preaching againſt Law. This he directs to the Right Reverend Biſhops of
<hi>London, Lincoln, Hereford, Carliſle,</hi> St. <hi>Davids,</hi> and
<hi>Peterborough, and others of their moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſome hope, though evil
Men and Deceivers wax worſe and worſe.</hi> What his hope is, he tells
them, <hi>If the ancient Chriſtians might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Apology in hope to
Heathen Emperours, may I not ſo much more to Chriſtian Biſhops? 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65960:100"/>You are more ſenſible than we, with what deep
ſenſe Men will ſhortly hear,</hi> Inaſmuch as you did it to one of the
leaſt of theſe my Brethren, you did it unto me. See his Charity to thoſe
whom he calls <hi>our beſt Biſhops!</hi> But in <hi>p.</hi> 233. he thus
concludes: <hi>And now we humbly lay theſe Petitions at your feet, and
beſeech you for the ſouls of many hundred thouſands, that you who call
your ſelves their Paſtors, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, will not deny
them the bread of Life. We beſeech you to come out of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces a while,
and be familiar with the People, and confer with all the Poor of the Pariſh,
and dwell in ſome Country Village as we have done,</hi> (who chooſe the
greateſt Cities and Towns) <hi>that you may not ſee many hundred
thouſands damned by your means, and you have nothing to ſay when it is to
late, but a</hi> non putaram: <hi>That the Inſtances of the Obduration
of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and the</hi> Phariſees, <hi>make you not afraid, lest
wrath come upon you to the utmost, while</hi> you pleaſe not God, and are
contrary to all Men, <hi>forbidding Chriſt's Labourers to preach to the
Ignorant and Impenitent,</hi> that they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
2.15. <hi>And O that God would make them ſenſible how many thouſand
Perſons damnation is like to be charged upon them for what they have already
done, for ſeventeen years hindring ſo many faithful Miniſters! I must
profeſs, if it were the last word that I ſhould ſpeak in the world, that
I had rather be the baſeſt Scavenger, yea, and ſuffer many deaths, than 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65960:101"/>be found at the Judgment Seat of Christ in the place and
guilt of thoſe of you who have done what is done againſt the Goſpel and
Church of Chriſt in this Land.</hi> Doth not the Reader bluſh for Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> to read ſuch arrogant Cenſures from a dying Man concerning
his betters? and all this too cauſeleſly, as I ſhall prove out of his own
words. He asks the Queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 236. <hi>Why I write all this to
you, and not to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and the Parliament?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>It is
not them, nor any of their Laws or Actions, which in all this Book I intend to
ſpeak againſt.</hi> (Mend. Mag.) For though he had indeed done it
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in other, yet this Book was penned on purpoſe to juſtifie
the preaching of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, though forbidden by Law. P. 102. He
raiſeth the Objection of <hi>preaching in Cities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>against
Laws.</hi> And Anſw. <hi>Did not the ancient Chriſtians alſo diſobey a
lawful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>er when forbidden?</hi>
&amp;c. As if Chriſtian Magiſtrates were to be reputed as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Perſecutors. But to omit this, <hi>p.</hi> 104. he ſays (N.B.) <hi>No
Biſhops have ſilenced us by Spiritual Government that we know of, but only
as Barons by the Secular Laws, to which they gave their Votes,</hi> (and he
acknowledgeth) <hi>all did not.</hi> And if any ſhall read the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to
thoſe Acts, he may plainly ſee, the cauſe of making them was not only the
late dreadful Experience which the Nation had of the Confuſions cauſed by
the preaching of ſuch Men, but their preſent endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65960:101"/>us to the like again; which (all thoſe Acts
notwithſtanding) they are ſtill labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for. This is evident, that Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> though he were Ordained by a Biſhop, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
(though as he confeſſeth, <hi>he had not read the Book of Ordination, nor
exactly weighed what he ſubſcribed to,</hi> p. 59. for it ſeems, he was
<hi>a paſſive Conformist,</hi> and one that came into the Church to find a
better opportunity to pull it down;) he did partake with Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> in
an Antipathy againſt <hi>Lordly Prelacy,</hi> and glorieth in being ſtiled
the <hi>Antiſignanus Presbyterorum,</hi> p. 11. And <hi>p.</hi> 6. he tells
us of one <hi>Fenne,</hi> a famous Country Non-conformiſt, <hi>who with a
loud voice would ſay Amen to all the Prayers in the Liturgy, except that for
Biſhops; to which his ſilence was accounted a diſſent.</hi> Doubtleſs
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is of the ſame mind; he cannot pray for them, leſt it
ſhould ſeem <hi>a compliance with Church Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>a frame of
Government deſtructive of the Churches Miniſtry,</hi> p. 241. <hi>and with
ſuch Perſons as profeſſing themſelves Fathers of the Church, are
grand Enemies of Chriſt and Souls, and the Captains in the Army of the
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> p. 243. I have heard a late Report of a Rebel in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who being under Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, was put in mind of begging
Pardon, and to ſay, <hi>God bleſs the King:</hi> but his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was,
<hi>He would not purchaſe his life at ſo dear a rate.</hi> Let the Reader
judge how near Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> approacheth that temper, <hi>who will not,
and cannot indeed pray for the Biſhops as ſuch, but<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65960:102"/>rather ſuffer many deaths, than be in their caſe,</hi> &amp;c.
How amazing a paſſage is that, p. 135. <hi>When you are in the dust, the
world will not be afraid of you, but freely tread upon you,</hi> Hic Jacet,
(Mr. <hi>Love</hi> did as bad by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Land</hi> while he was
alive) <hi>and cast up your bones to make room for others, and talk of you and
your acts as freely as of King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth, Queen</hi> Mary,
<hi>Biſhop</hi> Bonner <hi>and</hi> Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>are now talked of.</hi> As
if our Biſhops were the Succeſſours of thoſe, and not of <hi>Cranmer,
Latimer, Ridly, Hooper,</hi> and other Martyrs of that Age, who died for the
Defence of that Reformation, which our Biſhops ſtill defend againſt both
Papiſts and Fanaticks. But <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam post mortem invidia:</hi> How
ſollicitous is dying Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to bequeath a double porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his
Anti-Prelatical Spirit to the People; who by propheſying what they will be,
tells them what he would have them to be; (i.e.) <hi>Perpetual and implacable
Enemies to the Biſhops,</hi> p. 187. And in his Prognoſtick, to which he
refers, how often doth he croak over his Cant of <hi>Perjury, a ſin meet for
none but utterly debauched Conſciences, and ſuch as threatneth dreadful
ruine. Such principles and practices would make us guilty of the perjury and
impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of many hundred thouſand perſons,</hi> p. 154. And <hi>p.</hi>
219. <hi>Aggravated perjury, deliberate ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rebellious profeſſion of
diſobedience to God, owning great and publick ſins, corrupting holy
Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. P. 221. <hi>The ſins which we fear</hi> 
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:65960:102"/>(<hi>viz.</hi> in Conformity) <hi>be of the greatest
ſort that Hell ſuggeſteth, perjury, and owning the perjury of
thouſands, and doing that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to the preaching of
impenitency, and ſaying, Repent not, for I declare it is no ſin, and lying
deliberately, and making a publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial profeſſion of
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation and Church Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and of our reſolution never to obey
God in doing any duty of ours in order to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. Will any
Man believe that Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is ſo grievouſly perſecuted, who
hears him thus affronting the Laws, and reviling and provoking Authority? P.
200. <hi>It may be your great Patrons may die, or fall, or forſake you; and
then your hearts are broken. It may be death</hi> (he ſeemeth to ſpeak of a
violent death, as <hi>p.</hi> 204. <hi>One</hi> Felton <hi>may end the great
Duke of</hi> Buckingham, p. 205. <hi>Or they may meet with ſuch Executioners
as Cardinal</hi> Beton) <hi>may enter into your Families, and make you think

if blood or deſtruction be the means you trust to, you muſt ſet up a
Shambles or Trade of Butchery, and make it the profeſſion of all your
lives,</hi> &amp;c. which I abhor to relate what he there talks at large. And
<hi>p.</hi> 226, 227. <hi>The world already thinks that the Clergy are ſo
covetous, proud, and envious, that like the great Dog that hath got the
Carrion, ſnarls at every little Dog that looketh at them, ſuſpecting they
come to take ſome from him: it is the common opinion, that the Clergy are the
Incendiaries.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:65960:103"/>
                  <hi>Troublers of the World; and that the
worst Princes left to themſelves, are not half ſo cruel against the
faithful preachers and practiſers of Chriſtianity, as if they perſecuted
it</hi> (eo nomine) <hi>as the proud and covetous Clergy are.</hi> Now that it
hath been Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s work to effect this temper in the People, he
gives us this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, beſides what I might mention in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and <hi>Kedderminſter,</hi> p. 90. <hi>I love to inſtance where I dwell,
and ſee becauſe of certainty. This Market Town of</hi> Barnet <hi>ten miles
from</hi> London, <hi>was ſo extreamly addicted to your way, ſo impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of the Directory and Miniſtry now cast out, that one who was their Miniſter
in times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation told me, he was fain to leave them, and
profeſſed he was really afraid leſt they would have put him into the
Grave, and buried him alive, for burying a Corps</hi> (without Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
<hi>according to the Directory: And now the Caſe is ſo much altered, that
though the Town conſiſts ſo much of Inns and Ale-houſes, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meeting near the Church is ſo much crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the Churches were, and the
Church is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt empty.</hi> Egregias vero laudes, &amp; ſpolia ampla! the
Inns and Ale-houſes are become Conventicles, by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Reformation, and the Church forſaken.</p>
               <p>From <hi>p.</hi> 197, to 210. you have a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cry of the
bloodineſs of Biſhops, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them to <hi>Foxes, Wolves, and Kites,
that live on fleſh, and devour thoſe that are better than
themſelves,</hi> p. 201. Yet, contrary to all<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65960:103"/>this
clamour, he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 104. <hi>No Biſhops have ſilenced as by
ſpiritual Government,</hi> (i.e. as Biſhops) <hi>but only as Barons by the
Secular Laws to which they gave their Votes, which yet all did not.</hi> Yea
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> acknowledgeth their favour to himſelf in particular:
<hi>For my part,</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>ibidem</hi>) <hi>I have one or two of
their Licenſes never recalled nor nulled.</hi> Are theſe Men ſuch
horrible Perſecutors, who did no more than the whole Nation in Parliament
have done for Peace ſake? yet all their Silencing and Sufferings are charged
moſt invidiouſly on the Biſhops, as if it were done by their ſole
Authority: for one reaſon why they cannot give over Preaching is, <hi>p.</hi>
241. <hi>n.</hi> 11. <hi>It will be an encouraging compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with
Church-tyranny, to give over preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as oft as Biſhops forbid us,
becauſe we will not take their Oaths, and be ſtigmatiz'd with their
PER.</hi> The Biſhops as Biſhops require no more now, than what was
required when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and others ſubſcribed at their
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and they are moſt likely to bear the PER, who act contrary, not
they who act conformably to their Subſcription. The great cry of Perjury is
raiſed in favour of the <hi>Covenant:</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 112.
of his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology,</hi> ſays, <hi>I never heard abjuring</hi> (the
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) <hi>was required of the Miniſters: they are only to ſubſcribe,
That there is no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on them or any other Perſon to endeavour any
change or alteration of Government in the<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65960:104"/>Church.</hi> And
can this be thought a ſufficient reaſon for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> a Man of 74
years old to cry out as a Child that hath fancied a Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, till he puts
himſelf into dangerous fits, and afrights all the Neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>So bold and bloody are his accuſations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the
Biſhops and Clergy eſpecially, for Perſecution and Perjury, that if a
Stranger ſhould read them, he might think them meer <hi>Cannibals</hi> that
lived on Humane fleſh, or incarnate fiends that delighted in Sacrifices of
Blood; though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> all the while knows them to be very innocent
and tame perſons. For though he repreſent them as <hi>Lions greedy of
prey,</hi> yet dares he pluck them by the Beards, and diſgorge his filth in
their mouths; and after all imaginable provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>truſts himſelf
between their Teeth and Claws,</hi> as he is pleaſed to phraſe it. So great
a Maſter of Diſcipline is Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> But though he deal thus with
the Biſhops, yet he ſhould not make ſo bold with the King and
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their <hi>Tearing Engines of the Laws,</hi> as to write whole
Volumes in defiance of them.</p>
               <p>When the two <hi>Cromwels</hi> were on the Throne, he taught a
Doctrine quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his <hi>Apology for their practice</hi> then under
King <hi>Charles.</hi> Then he taught us, <hi>That God never inſtituted
Churches to be kept up in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to thoſe Chriſtian Magiſtrates
which he commands us to obey upon pain of Damnation.</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:65960:104"/>p. 352. of his H. Commonwealth. And <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> 319. That
<hi>Diſobedience to our Rulers, is in Miniſters double treaſon and
wickedneſs.</hi> And 240 <hi>Theſis,</hi> That <hi>it is neceſſary to
the Churches peace, that no private Congregations may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or
Antichurches erected, without approbation or toleration from the
Magiſtrates:</hi> And <hi>that if private Aſſemblies be permitted
unlimitedly, then,</hi> 1. <hi>It will be impoſſible to reſtrain
Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Infidelity, or Impiety: Yea,</hi> 2. <hi>They may meet to plot
againſt the Magiſtrate. And no Aſſemblies whatſoever</hi> (he means
beſides thoſe of the Pariſh-Church) <hi>are to be allowed by the

Miniſters to preach or exerciſe the reſt of their Office in their
Dominions, they are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed;</hi> as he inſtances in <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Solomon</hi> taking down and ſetting up Prieſts, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Officers
in the Houſe of God. Were the two <hi>Cromwels</hi> ſuch as <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Solomon,</hi> to be intruſted with the Houſe of God? and is King
<hi>Charles</hi> like <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whoſe intereſt it was to
ſuppreſs the true Worſhip of God, and permit Calves to be ſet up at
<hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel?</hi> I would fain ſee Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Reaſons for the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of the Churches</hi> then, more than now;
and wherein <hi>Oliver</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> did more Piouſly,
Faithfully, and Prudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Government, than King
<hi>Charles.</hi> I know it will grate on Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s ſpirit to
have his <hi>Theſes</hi> ſo often urged, ſeeing he hath deſired the
whole Book might be taken as <hi>non<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65960:105"/>Scriptus;</hi> and
that he retracts <hi>ſome things</hi> (though he adds) <hi>not all,</hi> nor
tells us any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. But, <hi>Quid verba audiam, quum fact a videam?</hi>
To what purpoſe ſerves a <hi>Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> againſt <hi>plain
matter of Fact,</hi> and daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereby Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtill
vindicates many ill things delivered in that Book? which he doth expreſly
alſo in the cloſe of his Preface to the <hi>Second Plea,</hi> where he
affirms, <hi>That in all the times of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation he ſaid and wrote, that
the Kings Perſon is inviolable, and to be judged by none, either Peer or
Parliament; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King may deſtroy nor hurt the Kingdom, nor
the Kingdom the King.</hi> And then adds, <hi>That the very Book accuſed</hi>
(<hi>viz.</hi> The H. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth) <hi>goeth on ſuch principles, and hath
not a word meet to tempt a man in his wits to this accuſation.</hi> The
contrary to which hath been often rehearſed, to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s great
regret. And his Brother Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> rightly tells him, That <hi>they who
will take liberty to ſpeak what they pleaſe, muſt be content to hear
ſometime what will diſpleaſe.</hi> And I would deſire him to reconcile
the former <hi>Theſes</hi> of the Obedience of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters under
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> to his late Doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Diſobedience to our
preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. For <hi>p.</hi> 226. of his <hi>Firſt Plea,</hi> he
teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>That Paſtors preached againſt the will of Princes for Three
hundred years.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>That God wrought Miracles to
juſtifie ſuch Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers when forbidden by Chriſtian Princes, who ſpake
freely after their Tongues were cut out;<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65960:105"/>That there is a
wo unto them if they preach not, and many woes to them that ſhall forbid
them;</hi> which is the ſubject of his <hi>Apology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> wonder that no Man An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers theſe
Books of his, when the ſmoak, and flame, and ſtink of them is ſo horribly
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and inacceſſible, as if it came forth from the
Bottomleſs-pit? And this is the work of his Fellow-labourers, of whom he
ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 163. <hi>There is not this day on Earth a more
conſcionable, godly, faithful Party of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, than
thoſe that are now ejected, ſilenced, Nonconformiſts in</hi> England:
<hi>And his Teſtimony</hi> (he ſpeaks it of himſelf) <hi>ſhall be
believed when the Defamers and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators ſhall not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Books and ſome other, (of which hereafter) he covers
over with much combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter, prepared many years paſt,
<hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch falſe and bloody Plotters</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the
Biſhops) <hi>as would perſwade the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the
Nonconformiſts are Presbyterians and Fanaticks: That it was ſuch
Presbyterians that killed his Father; and that their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are
rebellious, and that they are plotting a Rebellion and his death; and laſtly,
that this is the Genius of the Parliament.</hi> I hope what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> may do, no other Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth accuſe him of ſuch
horrid crimes. All this we have in the Title-page of his <hi>Second Plea for
Peace:</hi> But as the Learned Doctor obſerved of the <hi>Firſt Plea, it
looks<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65960:106"/>as if he had deſigned theſe Books on purpoſe
to repreſent the Clergy of our Church as a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of notorious lying and
perjured Villains.</hi> Theſe and divers other Fire-brands he fixeth in the
top of the Fabrick, as if that could not be purged but with Fire, pretending it
was guilty of many heinous Sins in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it: And when that
Reverend Doctor endeavored to quench thoſe Juniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coals which had well-nigh
ſet all in a flame, he flies in his face, charging him with <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for
Preſumption, Profanation, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs, and Schiſm,
p.</hi> 73. of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to the Dr's <hi>Sermon.</hi> Again, when
the Dr. ſaid, <hi>that preaching in oppoſition to the Laws eſtabliſhed,
is contrary to the Doctrine of all the Nonconformiſts of former times;</hi>
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>This Aſſertion is ſo
raſh and falſe in matters of notorious fact, that it weakeneth his
reverence of the Doctors judgment in matters of Right,</hi> p. 8. So that the
Doctor might well ſay, that <hi>he wrote that Book in a continued fit of
Anger.</hi> And how could it be otherwiſe, ſeeing that, as Biſhop
<hi>Burnet</hi> relates of the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter, when God gave him a
ſight of his ſins, that he confeſſed he had been drunk five years
together:</hi> So Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had been diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with an habit of
wrath and rage againſt the Government of the Church ever ſince he was
Nineteen years old; how could he chuſe but write with the ſpirit of Gall
and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt againſt ſuch an Adverſary as would diſſect 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65960:106"/>him alive, and diſcover all the Diſtempers of that
dying Man? And what could Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do leſs than call the Doctor's
Sermon <hi>a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Sermon,</hi> that would ſo divide Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> that makes Union impoſſible in any Church but what he
himſelf ſhall give being and union to? And yet this Man of Wrath is angry
with himſelf, that he was not more angry with the Doctor: For <hi>p.</hi> 12.
of <hi>Second Defence, I profeſs</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I felt ſo little
paſſion in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Book, that I think verily I ſinned all the while
for want of a livelier ſenſe of the ſin and hurt which I was detecting by
my Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And in his Title-page, dividing the Doctor's Book into
<hi>Accuſations, Reaſonings,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> he pronounceth
them all <hi>untrue; i.e.</hi> (in plain Engliſh) <hi>You lie, Sir, in all
that you have written.</hi> Perhaps Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may not account this
<hi>Paſſion,</hi> but <hi>Zeal;</hi> And his admirers ſay, he is <hi>a
Stranger to Spite and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> but he hath <hi>a very quick and earneſt
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, and his ſtile is very keen and pungent.</hi> Yea, and they
think it lawful for him too, to make the Scripture ſerve his paſſion, and
rail in holy Language; for doubtleſs his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples think that in the
Title-page, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5,6. well applied to the Doctor, <hi>Perverſe
diſputings of men of corrupt minds, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the truth,
ſuppoſing that gain is godlineſs; from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf;</hi>
which in plain Engliſh is, that the Doctor is one of thoſe Men, and you are
bound to have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65960:107"/>with him: For Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another name) repreſents the Doctor to be
<hi>a moſt unskilful, proud, partial, obſtinate, cruel impertinent
Adverſary.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Silveſter</hi> in his Preface, ſpeaking of
the Author <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>I have heard him
great and copious in commendation of ſeveral Prelates and Conformiſts,</hi>
and that he particularly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Reverend Biſhops of
<hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Eli, (i.e.)</hi> Biſhop <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
and Biſhop <hi>Patrick</hi> as Perſons greatly admired, and highly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, and of their readineſs to ſerve the Publick intereſt both Civil
and Religious, he doubted not, it was therefore his bitter Zeal that
tranſported him to write ſuch ſcandalous invectives contrary to his
Knowledge and Conſcience. But as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, in defence of Mr.
<hi>Baxter, Some Men have humours and ways of their own.</hi> And this, it
ſeems, is the proper humour of that Party; They think with <hi>Jonah,</hi>
they <hi>do well to be angry,</hi> that God hath ſpared us ſo long; and
becauſe he ſuffered their <hi>Gourd</hi> to <hi>ſpring up and cover their
heads</hi> for a time, <hi>whereof they were exceeding glad,</hi> now that he
hath ſuffered a <hi>Worm to ſtrike it, and make it wither, and the Wind and
the Sun beats on their heads,</hi> they are deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry for their
Gourd, and juſtifie their anger even againſt God; they <hi>do well to be
angry even unto death,</hi> Jonah 4.9.</p>
               <p>His Treatiſe of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> he ſays in the
Title-page, <hi>was meditated</hi> 1640. <hi>when the</hi> &amp;c. 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65960:107"/>
                  <hi>Oath was impoſed; written</hi> 1671. <hi>and
publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi> 1680. <hi>by the call of Mr.</hi> H.D. <hi>and the
importunity of our Superiours, who demanded the reaſon of our Nonconformity:
The deſign was, the concord of all the Proteſtants who can never unite in
the preſent impoſitions, and for neceſſary reformation of
Pariſh-Churches, and thoſe abuſes which elſe will keep up in all Ages a
ſucceſſion of Nonconformiſts; and to give an account why we dare not
covenant by Oath or Subſcription to endeavour the</hi> (amending)
<hi>alteration of the Church-government,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>i.e.</hi> in plain
Engliſh) againſt an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. P. 140. of his <hi>Second
Part,</hi> we have this pathetical Exclamation: <hi>Alas Lord, How long ſhall
Chriſts enemies</hi> (the Biſhops) <hi>be Paſtors of his Flocks? and the
ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent be the great Inſtrument that must break the Serpents
head; and the lovers of ſin be they that must be the ſuppreſſers of it;
and thoſe employed to teach in Knowledge, who themſelves will not know; and
to preach up Holineſs, that will not endure it?</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 124.
<hi>The truth is, that is an excellent perſon to us, who is an odious and
contemptible perſon to the Prelates. If he will make the People believe that
Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians are Rebels, and Diſciplinarians are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious brain-ſick
fellows, living in Hypocriſie: And that praying without Book, and much
prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, is Fanaticiſm; and that none are worthy to Preach the Goſpel
who will not ſwear to be true to the Prelatical intereſt: That
Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65960:108"/>in a conformable Man is a tolerable
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; and that their ignoranteſt Nonſence is fitter to ſave Souls
and edifie the Church, than the Labours of the Holy and Learned
Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts: That</hi> Calvin <hi>was a Rogue</hi> (as
<hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi> ſaid of the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond:</hi>)
<hi>That</hi> Cartwright <hi>and</hi> Ameſius <hi>were diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
factious Schiſmaticks, unworthy to preach or be endured; this is a Son of the
Church, and an excellent Perſon.</hi> P. 213. of the <hi>ſecond Part,</hi>
Confect. 3. He ſays, <hi>That to Swear, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That
though Millions ſhould ſwear to endeavour a Reformation of Epiſcopacy in
their Places and Callings by lawful means</hi> (which is his addition, there is
no obligation lieth on any one of them ſo to endeavour it) <hi>the Lord have
mercy on that Land, City, or Soul that is guilty of it.</hi> And
<hi>Conſect.</hi> 4. <hi>All carnal Interest, and all carnal Reaſon, is on
the Dioceſans ſide; and all the luſts of the heart of Man, and
conſequently all that the Devil can do; and therefore while carnal
Chriſtians make a Religion of their Luſts and Intereſts, and Pride, and
Covetouſneſs, and Idleneſs are more predominant than the fear of God and
the love of Souls, no wonder if the Dioceſans Cauſe prevail with
ſuch.</hi> Conſect. 7. <hi>Take but from ſuch Prelates the Plumes it hath
ſtollen from Magiſtrates and Presbyters, and it will be a naked thing and
ſimple name.</hi> He ſays in the Preface, <hi>The Sufferers will call the
Prelates Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, Wolves in Sheeps clothing, who are 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65960:108"/>known by their fruits, their teeth and claws.</hi> P.
163. part 1. <hi>It is the Prelacy that maketh almost all the Sects that be
in</hi> England <hi>this day;</hi> (whereas thoſe little Foxes were not heard
of until the Wild-boars had broken down the Fences of Epiſcopacy) <hi>and
when they ſee what Miniſters, and how many hundred of them are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,
and what Fellows are ſet up in their ſtead, they think they can never
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y far enough from ſuch Prelates:
and we that dwell among them do take them that diſlike their courſe and
ways, to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the most religious and ſober People in the Land,</hi>
(but I think Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpake in jeſt, when he adds) <hi>excepting
always the King and Parliament.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 167, 168. <hi>That before
the Prelates had again ruled ſeven years, there were ſeven and ſeven
againſt them, for one that was ſo before:</hi> Which is a notorious
falſhood, there being a general Conformity until a Toleration was granted.
And <hi>p.</hi> 161. he proclaims thus: <hi>I am one of the eighteen hundred
that have been ſilenced by better Authority than the Prelates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; yet I
think I am bound in Conſcience to exerciſe the Miniſtry which I received,
whatever I ſuffer: and if the Sword ſtraitned me no more than my
Conſcience of the Biſhops prohibition, I ſhould be very little hindred;
for that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is vaniſhed into Air,</hi> p. 163. And ſo it
ſeems is the power of the Sword too with him: for that he means by <hi>better
Authority,</hi> the Laws eſtabliſhed by King and Parliament. And yet this
Man had taught other Doctrine: for <hi>p.</hi> 30.<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65960:109"/>of his
<hi>firſt Plea, Princes and Rulers may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all that preach Rebellion and
Sedition, and puniſh them if they do it; and may hinder the incorrigible,
whoſe preaching will do more hurt than good, from exerciſing the Miniſtry
in their Dominions.</hi> P. 32. <hi>They ſhould ſee that their Kingdoms be
well provided of publick Preachers and Catechiſts, and may be due means
compel the ignorant to hear and learn what Chriſtianity is.</hi> Sect. 36.
<hi>They may, when a Peoples ignorance, faction, or wilfulneſs make them
refuſe all that are truly fit for them, urge them to accept the best, and may
poſſeſs ſuch of the publick Temples and Maintenance, and make it the
Peoples duty to conſent, as is aforeſaid.</hi> (No great need then of
<hi>the Peoples conſent,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo much contends
for.) Sect. 37. <hi>They ought to hinder Preachers from uncharitable and
unrighteous railing at each other, and unpeaceable controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and
contentions.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 35. <hi>ſect.</hi> 40. <hi>They may make
their own Officers</hi> circa Sacra <hi>to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Magiſtratical
Power; and if they au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize any particular Biſhops or Pastors to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any ſuch power as belongs to the Prince to give, not contrary to
Chriſt's Laws,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we judge that the Subjects ſhould obey all
ſuch even for Conſcience ſake.</hi> P. 117. <hi>We deny not</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>but if the generality of the Miniſtry obtain their liberty by ſome
ſmall tolerable ſin or errour, and the ſounder part be few and
unneceſſary in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, prudence obligeth them to go to ſome other
place that needeth them, and never to exerciſe<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65960:109"/>their
Miniſtry where in true Reaſon it is like to do more hurt than good.</hi>
And of this he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Magiſtrate Judge, <hi>p.</hi> 265. of his <hi>Way
of Concord.</hi> Yet <hi>p.</hi> 244. of his <hi>Plea,</hi> he ſays, <hi>That
though the execution of the Laws have coſt ſome excellent Men their lives
already, we may know, that no execution ſhort of death or utter
diſablement, will make the moſt conſcionable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their duty.</hi>
And <hi>p.</hi> 249. <hi>Why we ſhould not ſpeak openly rather than in
ſecret; and what but a Spirit of Envy or Carnal Intereſt, croſs to the
intereſt of Chriſt, ſhould grudge at ſuch preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we cannot
tell.</hi> Nor can any one recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe Contradictions.</p>
               <p>One thing I ſhall obſerve from his
<hi>Church-Hiſtorian,</hi> mentioned in the Preface, <hi>That when</hi>
Philip Nerius <hi>ſet up his Oratorian Exerciſes at</hi> Rome, <hi>it was
found neceſſary (to win the people) to uſe large, affectionate,
extemporate Prayers, Expoſitions, and Sermons.</hi> Yet when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of
<hi>Worceſter</hi> ſays, <hi>This practice was brought into</hi> England
<hi>by the Jeſuits, to bring the Liturgy into Contempt,</hi> in the Preface
to his <hi>Hiſtory of Separation;</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> replies,
<hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>That this is a ſad ſaying, and that there is no
proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that the Jeſuits ſhould be the firſt ſetters up of this
way in</hi> England, (though the Biſhop gave two inſtances of it in Matter
of Fact.) And ſays in the Preface to his <hi>ſecond Defence,</hi> That
<hi>the Biſhops's Book is made up of three parts:</hi> 1. <hi>Of untrue
Accuſations:</hi> 2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntrue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Citations abundance:</hi> 3.
<hi>Fallacious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings.</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:65960:110"/>As if there were not
one true word in the whole Book: though even this imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Philip
Nerius</hi> in extemporary Exerciſes and ſeparate Meetings, is by Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf parallel'd with ours as the Original and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
<hi>p.</hi> 22. of Preface to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Now or Never: The
Meetings of the</hi> Oratorians <hi>and their Exerciſes, are ſo like
thoſe now abhorred by many,</hi> &amp;c. Then comes forth his <hi>first</hi>
and <hi>ſecond Plea for Peace.</hi> Of the firſt, the Biſhop of
<hi>Worceſter</hi> ſays, <hi>It ſeems to be deſigned on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to
repreſent the Clergy of our Church as a company of notorious, lying, perjured
Villains, for conforming to the Laws of the Land, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders eſtabliſhed,
with no leſs than thirty Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Sin of Conformity.</hi> And Mr.
<hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his Anſwer ſeems to juſtifie it: And with a great
deal of vain-glory, in the latter end of that Book printeth a complemental
Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent him from Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> in 1661. to ſhew how he loves
the Applauſe of Men; of which, he ſays, he had been ſurfeited with Humane
Applauſe, <hi>p.</hi> 133. which rather than he would want, he blows a
Trumpet himſelf in another Book called the <hi>Only way to Concord,</hi>
ſaying in the Preface to Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
I am fully perſwaded that in this Book I have told you a righter way of
Chriſtian Concord, more divine, ſure, harmleſs, and comprehenſive,
fitted by Christ himſelf to the intereſt of all good Men, yea of the
Church and all the World.</hi> He ſpeaks as if he had gotten an infallible
Spirit,<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65960:110"/>and had not only the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but the
<hi>Pope</hi> in his belly. Whereas that way of Concord will rather prove a
means of perpetuating Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Diviſions in the Church. In that Book he
calls the Biſhops <hi>Thorns and Thiſtles, the Military Inſtruments of
the Devil,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts them to be <hi>mad Dogs;</hi> applying a Welch
Proverb to them, <hi>Though thy Dog be thy own, trust him not when he is
mad;</hi> in the <hi>Premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He rails at the Laws in a Verſe of
<hi>Ovid:</hi> 
                  <q> 
                     <l>

               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> propounded ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

reaching our neceſſities, but much better than nothing,</hi> p. 21. of his

                  <hi>That he</hi> (An. 1660.) <hi>once
made it the moſt earneſt action of his life, to prevent the building of
this Wall or Hedge:</hi> And adds, <hi>I will do the best I can while I live to
pull it down.</hi> And I believe him: for then he hopes he ſhall be ſet up
not as a Parochial Biſhop, but an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, ſucceeding the Apoſtles
in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Office of Government; or at leaſt as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the
King. And I have heard of a Propoſal, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> may be two of the firſt Archbiſhops. P. 66. of the laſt
part of that Book, he ſays, <hi>That which hath been the chief cauſe and
engine of Diviſion, will never become the means or terms of concord: but
ſuch are the multitude of unneceſſary, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, humane Decrees, Laws,
and Canons of Faith and Religion, whatever the proud and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſay to the
contrary.</hi> (Yet <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>In the multitude of
Counſellors there is ſafety.</hi>) P. 59. <hi>In a word</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>Councils of Biſhops have been but Church Armies, of which at firſt the
Patriarchs were Generals, and afterward Popes and Emperours, who fought it out
for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</hi> And p. 71, 72. he condemns the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> and
<hi>Calviniſt,</hi> the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> and <hi>Behemiſts,</hi> as
well as the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> ways of Concord: And adds, <hi>What the
Independants have done towards Diviſion and Separation, it is in vain in this
Age to recite; and many wiſe Men think that the Presbyterians over-violent
rejecting of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, ſetting up unordained Elders, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Churches, as headed by National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65960:111"/>are
diviſive and unwarrantable, as their making by the Scotch Covenant the
renouncing of the Prelacy to be the Teſt of National Concord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
was.</hi> What remains then? Nothing but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Model is the
<hi>Only, Only, Only way of Concord: More ſure, divine appointed by Chriſt
himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. But where any Perſon ſhould find that Rule of which
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks ſo confuſedly himſelf, is the great
Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for thus he concludes that Book: 1. <hi>Approving the beſt:</hi>
2. <hi>Tolerating the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> 3. <hi>Sacraments free, and not
forced:</hi> 4. <hi>The intolerable reſtrained, the Teſt of Toleration
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this:</hi> 5. <hi>Whether ſuch tolerated Worſhip do more good or
hurt:</hi> 6. <hi>Magiſtrates keeping all in peace, would heal us. But alas,
Magiſtrates, Laws, and Power, are reſiſted: Every Faction count
themſelves more tolerable than others, yea condemn others as intolerable; and
judge of men and things at beſt, by their agreeing with their own
perſwaſions; and ſo the</hi> Only way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord <hi>will leave us
ſtill in Confuſion.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> fearing the Book would
fall into the hands of bad Neighbours, he ſends it forth with the higheſt
Commendations. In the Preface to his <hi>ſecond Defence, I value it</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>above all the reſt, being aſſured that the Churches will
never otherwiſe be healed, than by that impartial, ſure, and eaſie
Catholick way, which ſome have reviled, but none ſince that I know of
confuted;</hi> nor need they: for it ſo confutes it ſelf, that there needs
no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65960:112"/>but the reading of it. Here it is
that he calls the Clergy <hi>Tyrants,</hi> p. 37. <hi>Thorns and Thiſtles,
grievous Wolves, and the Military In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Devil.</hi> P. 123.
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the name of Biſhops, they are Troublers, Perſecutors, and
Deſtroyers.</hi> P. 47. Here he ſays, <hi>That to tell them as Mr.</hi>
Dodwel <hi>doth, that no unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing is impoſed, will as much ſatisfie
them, as if he had ſaid that lying, perjury, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately covenanting
againſt God's Precepts, and for corrupting his ſacred Doctrine, Worſhip,
and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, are lawful things.</hi> P. 9. of his laſt part, He
<hi>accounts all Biſhops and Paſtors that have not the conſent of the
People, to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> And infers, <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>If the Temple
or Tythes be given to a Prieſt of Biſhop not lawfully called or conſented
to by the Flock, and another be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> by the
People) <hi>whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate caſteth out of the Temple and Tythes, it
is the Peoples duty to adhere to him that is juſtly called; it is not always
a duty to adhere to him whom the Magiſtrate impoſeth: the Churches met
againſt the will of the Magiſtrates above three hundred years.</hi> As if
our Magiſtrates were Heathen Perſecutors: for <hi>Chriſtian
Magiſtrates</hi> (he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 143.) <hi>muſt keep peace among
all, both approved and tolerated, and not ſuffer any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable Preaching
or Diſputes which tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Love and Quietneſs, nor ſuffer
railing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies againſt each other to be publiſhed or printed.</hi> Now
whether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s way be the <hi>Only way of Concord,</hi> or needs
any<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65960:112"/>other Confutation, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as the <hi>Way of Concord,</hi> ſuch are the
<hi>Pleas for Peace, (i.e.)</hi> Pleas for Schiſm and Diviſion, and ſuch
Trumpets as give no uncertain ſound to a War. For he proclaims the <hi>terms
for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity to be to them morally impoſſible, and is grieved that he
muſt ſet forth an unarmed Defence.</hi> He tells the People of many heinous
ſins in their Conformity, though he had formerly encouraged it, and
conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf as a Lay-man. But now <hi>God-fathers and
God-mothers,</hi> the <hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi> and <hi>kneeling at
Sacrament,</hi> reading <hi>the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> the <hi>Office of Burial,</hi>
all are offered to the People as ſinful; or they are encouraged to think them
ſo: for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks it is a ſin in Magiſtrates to puniſh
them for their Non-conformity. But the great quarrel is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws for
<hi>Subſcription</hi> and <hi>Renounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. of
which he ſpeaks dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things; calls them the <hi>tearing Engines of the
Law;</hi> repreſents the Magiſtrates as <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,</hi> and the
Clergy as <hi>a company of notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, lying, and perjured Villains.</hi> And
tells the Magiſtrates (in the Epiſtle, for they were the Legiſlators)
<hi>It is now ſeventeen years ſince near two thouſand Miniſters of
Chriſt were by Law forbidden the Exerciſe of their Office, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they
did conform to Subſcriptions, Covenants, Declarations, and Practices which we
durſt not do, becauſe we feared God.</hi> (As if the Magiſtrates had no
fear of God.) <hi>The reaſon of which<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65960:113"/>Impoſitions, it
is God, and not we, must have an account of from the Convocation,</hi> &amp;c.
By which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he muſt mean the Law-makers. He ſays, <hi>He had
read the Books written for Conformity, and thinks Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>had
written more for Anabaptiſtry, a late</hi> Hungarian <hi>for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy, many
for Drunkenneſs, Stealing and Lying in caſe of Neceſſity, than they for
the terms of Conformity, as the Conformiſts deſcribe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecond Plea</hi> is to the ſame tune: <hi>It was
publiſhed</hi> (ſaith he in the Title Page) <hi>to ſave our lives and the
Kingdoms peace from the falſe and bloody Plotters, who would perſwade the
King and People that the Non-conformiſts are Presbyterians and Fanaticks: And
next, that it was ſuch Presbyterians that killed his Father: That our
Principles are rebellious,</hi> &amp;c. and in the Preface makes this
Challenge; <hi>I deſire thoſe that ſeek our blood and ruine, to tell me,
if they can, what Body or Party of Men on Earth have more ſound and loyal
Principles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Obedience.</hi> He ſays indeed, <hi>p.</hi>
109. <hi>We are far from deſigning any abaſement of the Clergy; nor do we
deny or draw others to deny any due reverence to them; yet he calls the
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Popiſh Clergy-men, Thorns and Thiſtles,</hi> and the
<hi>Military Inſtruments of the Devil;</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of <hi>tearing
Engines, Goals, ſtarving, and bloody perſecution, ruine, and
death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very reading of ſuch things are to an<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65960:113"/>ingenuous Perſon a ſufficient Confutation of his Books, which
being ſo many, (for he tells us <hi>he hath written Eighty Books,</hi> and
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them in the Plural Number, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult it ſeems with the
Brotherhood) I am fearful to meddle farther with, leſt I ſhould provoke the
Legion (as ſome Learned Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have) to rent and tear them in pieces.
Such a Character as I have begun, if it were drawn by ſome Perſon that hath
known the Man and his Communication from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Wars (for I have
diſcovered no more than what he was pleaſed to tell the World in his
Writings) would be more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to ſilence and ſhame him, than all the
Laws of the Land, or all the Arguments of his Learned Adverſaries, how cogent
ſoever: for he is reſolved as long as he lives to have the laſt word, and
to anſwer all that ſhall be ſaid againſt him with down-right railing
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations to the People, ſophiſtical Evaſions, and rather than fail,
with plain Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. And of late days his wont is to confute his
Adverſaries as a young Scholar did <hi>Bellermine</hi> in one word,
<hi>Mentiris.</hi> But if <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictio ſit oppoſitionum Maxima,</hi>
(as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> grants) there is not a more common Lyar than he, who
hath beyond any other ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and flatly contradicted himſelf (for
of contradictory Propoſitions, if the one be true, the other is falſe,
<hi>i.e.</hi> a lye.) And this being another fit medium to confute many 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65960:114"/>of his Writings, I may, if occaſion ſerve, make up
one Volume more of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Works, ſuch, as though he be able to
ſplit a hair, he ſhall never be able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile. Sir <hi>Roger
L'Eſtrange</hi> hath given an Eſſay how far <hi>Richard</hi> differs from
<hi>Baxter.</hi> So did the Reflector on his <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion;</hi>
and though but in a few Particulars, yet it put him to a Nonplus, and ſet him
a whining, ſaying, <hi>I can reconcile my own words, though he cannot: And
all is not contradiction which Men that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not words think
ſo,</hi> p. 148. of his <hi>third Defence.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 151. <hi>I
never taught Mr.</hi> L'Eſtrange <hi>to underſtand my Writings; but I can
reconcile more than he can:</hi> as if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the difference
between a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Affirmative Propoſition. So that conſidering with
what Contumely, inſtead of Argument, he hath anſwered the Biſhop of
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> I think no diſcreet Man will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf to
anſwer his Impertinences. The <hi>Impleader</hi> of his <hi>firſt and
ſecond Plea,</hi> anſwered all that was conſiderable in thoſe Books,
and reflected on his Book of <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication;</hi>
who returns ſcarce any thing but a <hi>Mentiris,</hi> even ſometimes when
the <hi>Implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> repeated Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own words. The
<hi>Impleader</hi> anſwered that bold Challenge of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his
<hi>ſecond Plea,</hi> to ſhew what Party of Men were of more ſound
Judgment than the Non-conformiſts in point of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>p.</hi> 72.
ſhews who were <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:65960:114"/>who <hi>began the
War,</hi> who <hi>killed the Royal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr:</hi> on what rebellious Principles
they went, and who are plotting a Rebellion: of what dangerous conſequence
his immoral Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication is like to be. Which things Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
takes notice of in his <hi>third Defence,</hi> but in all haſte ſeeks to
evade them, and complains <hi>p.</hi> 146. of his <hi>third Defence,</hi> that
the Implea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>rakes up the actions of the evil Civil War, as if that were
any thing to the preſent Cauſe; that he heaps up abundance of untruths:
that he had fully confuted them before;</hi> and then takes up an Exclamation,
<hi>O miſerable World! where the very Preachers of Holineſs, Love, and
Peace, go on to the Grave and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Eternity, fighting againſt
Holineſs, Love, and Peace.</hi> And whether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be one of
that number, let the Reader Judge.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall demand to what purpoſe I have collected all
this? I ſhould not have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to give ſuch an Anſwer as Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> hath prompted, <hi>p.</hi> 151. of his <hi>third Defence, To
ſhew whether I be not a giddy, mutable, ſelf-contradicting Fool and
Knave.</hi> I ſhould only have inferred, that notwithſtanding all his
Pretences to Piety and Peace, he may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have ſome evil Deſigns
againſt both; for the Things related are moſtly Matters of Fact, recorded
by his own hand; and therefore I hope his ſeduced Followers will conſider
to what manner of Guide they have committed the conduct of their Souls; and
what proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65960:115"/>there is of gathering <hi>Grapes</hi>
from ſuch <hi>Thorns.</hi> And becauſe <hi>by the mouth of two or three
Witneſſes every thing is eſtabliſhed,</hi> I ſhall conclude with the
Teſtimony of two or three credible Perſons of his own Fraternity: The
firſt is Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> a noted Presbyterian, who, as Mr.
<hi>Bagſhaw</hi> reports, ſaid of Mr. <hi>Baxter, That it had been happy
for the Church of God if Mr.</hi> Baxter<hi>'s Friends had never ſent him to
School.</hi> The ſecond is Mr. <hi>Cawdry,</hi> who was of the ſame
Opinion. And he mentions a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as knowing in the Myſtery of
Godlineſs as either of them, who ſaid, <hi>That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
great noiſe raiſed about Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>he would end in fleſh and
blood.</hi> But theſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are nothing to that whereby the great
Judge, before whom he hath ſo often Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned others, will ſentence him
<hi>ex ore ſuo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any think Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is too ſeverely handled, let
him conſider it is by a Rod of his own making, though it be ſmartly
applied; and that though he be a thouſand times more obnoxious than the
worſt of thoſe Biſhops whom he ſo Calumniates, yet hath he ſpoken
maliciouſly and falſly of them; which the Collector hath not done by him.
The beſt is, the words of ſuch a ſcandalous Perſon will not be taken as
a blot. And I deſire my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Brethren not to be troubled at the
Railings or Reproaches of this Zealot; and that they would forbear troubling
him, who, as he ſaith, <hi>hath been a dying Man almoſt theſe 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65960:115"/>forty years.</hi> And though I never ſpake nor thought
half ſo ill of him, as he hath record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of himſelf; yet I ſhall
charitably hope and pray, That if he live to ſee himſelf in this his own
Glaſs, he will yet at laſt repent of thoſe Sins which he cannot but
condemn as very heinous and dangerous in the ſight of God and Man. I ſhall
be ſo charitable as to propoſe a method to eaſe him from one great fear.
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems much troubled to think that his Adverſaries may
have the laſt word of him. Now I perceive that Mr. <hi>Hicringle</hi> by
oppoſing the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> hath ingratiated himſelf
with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Preface to <hi>Second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
                  </note> of
whom he doth not come much ſhort in confident boaſting of himſelf. It is
a difficult matter to infuſe to him the Art of Defining and
Diſtinguiſhing, by which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is able to evade any
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: But this defect may be ſupplied, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> bequeath
him his Eighty Books, and enjoyn him eſpecially to ſtudy his <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Separation,</hi> and the <hi>heinous ſins of Conformity,</hi> which he
ſhall find often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to apply them on all occaſions. But let him
not do as in his <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> conceal the Name of his Benefactor, but
quote him <hi>totidem verbis;</hi> and ſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may have the
laſt word as long as the Faction continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But if this fear be thus
removed, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether a greater will not follow <hi>(viz.)</hi> of
being like <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who having ſet up<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65960:116"/>Calves
at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> in oppoſition to the eſtabliſhed
Worſhip, is recorded to have <hi>made Iſrael to ſin,</hi> not in his
life-time only, but long after his death: and how dreadful the final Sentence
of ſuch a one may be, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s moſt ſerious
Meditations. But if Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who ſo ſolemnly cites o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to
Judgment, continueth to go on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently to that dreadful day, I ſhall yet
pray for him as he doth for the Conformiſts, <hi>Lord have mercy on him.</hi>
And becauſe I doubt not but his Friends and Diſciples will raiſe a
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to perpetuate the Memory of their Maſter, I ſhall commend this
Characteriſtical epitaph.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS ON Some Material Paſſages.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt concerning the Marqueſs</hi> Antrim.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Baxter</hi> had related in his Penitent Confeſſion,
<hi>N.</hi> 22. That he had read the King's Letter in <hi>Spain</hi> to the
Pope, promiſing to venture Crown and Life for the Union of Chriſtian
Churches, including the <hi>Roman;</hi> and whether it be true, as the
<hi>Scots</hi> ſay, That the King put the Broad Seal to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, he determines not; but it's paſt doubt, that
the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> had his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> (if Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> means that he had a <hi>Commiſſion</hi>) for the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion in the firſt Inſurrection; yet he himſelf
ſays, That <hi>if a Subject had ſeen ſuch a Commiſſion, he was bound
not to believe that the King was the Authour of it,</hi> p. 16. of <hi>ſecond
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65960:117"/>Plea for Peace.</hi> What ground then had he for his
confidence, that Sir <hi>Philem O Neale</hi> had ſuch a Commiſſion as was
boaſted of? But the Cheat was undeniably proved; but <hi>Antrim</hi>'s
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was not heard of till after the end of the War; and then there
appeared no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of it; nor do we find it mentioned in any Hiſtory of
that War. I ſhall therefore ſet before the Reader Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Relation of that pretended Commiſſion, and then ſhew that his
preſumption could have no other ground, but his vile Opinion that the Royal
Martyr was a Papiſt, as he maliciouſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him; or from the
Relation of <hi>Ludlow,</hi> or ſome other of the Regicides in that
Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Pamphlet, which is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s chief Authority, called
<hi>Murder will out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may clear the Prejudice of ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as are too ready
to give Credit to this Relation of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I deſire them to take
notice that this Commiſſion to <hi>Antrim</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be granted

Counterfeiting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commiſſion, and pleading that to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their

them, at leaſt have confeſſed it when their Lives and Eſtates were
offered them upon that Condition before their Execution? And did not all three
deny that they knew of any Commiſſion from the King, or that he was privy
to their Riſing? How then is Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> paſt doubt, that the

               <hi>The Duke of</hi> Ormond <hi>and Council had the Cauſe of
the Marqueſs of</hi> Antrim <hi>before them, who had been one of the</hi>
Iriſh Rebels <hi>in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that War when two hundred thouſand
Proteſtants were murdered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Eſtate being ſequeſtred, he ſought Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of it when</hi> Charles <hi>the Second was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Ormond <hi>and the
Council judged against him as one of the Rebels. He brought his Cauſe over to
the King, and affirmed that what he did was by his Father's</hi> Conſent
<hi>and</hi> Authority. <hi>The King referred it to ſome worthy Members of
his Privy Council to examine what he had to ſhow. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon Examination they
reported, that they found that he had the King's</hi> Conſent, <hi>or</hi>
Letter of Inſtructions <hi>for what he did; which amazed many. Hereupon his
Majeſty,</hi> Charles <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, wrote to the Duke of</hi> Ormond
<hi>and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to reſtore his Eſtate, becauſe it appeared that 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65960:118"/>what he did was by his Father's</hi> Order <hi>or</hi>
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon the Parliaments old Adherents grew more confident
than ever of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Wars: And the very Deſtroyers of
the King, whom the first Parliamentarians cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Rebels, <hi>did
preſume alſo to juſtifie their Cauſe, and ſaid, That the Law of
Nature did warrant them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it ſtopt not here, for the Lord</hi> Mazarine, <hi>and
others of</hi> Ireland, <hi>did ſo far proſecute the Cauſe, as that the
Marqueſs of</hi> Antrim <hi>was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to produce, in the Parliament of</hi>
England, <hi>in the Houſe of Commons, a</hi> Letter <hi>of King</hi> Charles
<hi>the Firſt's, by which he gave him Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his taking up Arms; which
being read in the Houſe, put them into a ſilence: But yet ſo egregious
was their Loyalty and Veneration of Majeſty, that it put them not at all one
ſtep out of the way which they had gone in. But the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without doors
talked ſtrangely: Some ſaid, Did you not perſwade us that the King was
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iriſh Rebellion? And that the Rebels belied him, when they
ſaid they had his Warrant or Commiſſion? Do we not now ſee with what
mind he would have gone himſelf with an Army into</hi> Ireland <hi>to fight
against them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great deal more, not here to be mention'd, was vended
ſeditiouſly among the People; the ſum of which was intimated in a
Pamphlet which was printed, called, <hi>Murder will out;</hi> in which they
publiſhed the King's Letter, and<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65960:119"/>Animadverſions on it.
Some that were ſtill Loyal to the King, did wiſh that the King that now is,
had rather declared that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did only give the Marqueſs of
<hi>Antrim</hi> Commiſſion to raiſe an Army, as to have help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him
againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> and that his turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the murdering ſo
many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands there, was againſt his will; but <hi>quod
ſcriptum erat, ſcriptum erat.</hi> Although the old Parliamentarians
expounded the Actions and Declarations, both of the then King and Parliament,
by the Commentary of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet ſo did not the Loyal Royaliſts; or
at leaſt thought it no reaſon to make any change in their Judgments, or
ſtop in their Proceedings againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbyterians, and
other Non-conformable Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> adds in the Margin, <hi>We are not meet Judges
of the Reaſons of our Superiours Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> p. 83. part 3. of Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Life.</hi> By which he ſeemeth to intimate that the
Matter of Fact, how odiouſly and maliciouſly ſoever reported by him, is
true; but he leaves it to others to conſider and judge of the Reaſons of
it. He might with much more Ingenuity and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor have practiſed himſelf
that Advice which he gives to others in the ſecond part of the
<hi>Non-conformiſts Plea for Peace,</hi> p. 16. That <hi>if Subjects ſaw a
Commiſſion under the Broad Seal to ſeize the Guards, deſtroy the
Kingdom, or deliver it to Forreigners, they were bound to judge 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65960:119"/>that the King was not the Author of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
Subjects ſhould not have ill thoughts of Kings; though they be ſinful,
their Faults are neither to be aggravated nor divulged.</hi> This is good
Advice, and would have utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the pretence of Sir <hi>Phelim O
Neale,</hi> and thoſe bloody Papiſts that joyned with him in that execrable
Maſſacre, for which they pretended a Commiſſion under the Broad Seal;
whereas it appeared that the Broad Seal then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">See <hi>Burlace</hi>'s <hi>Hiſt. of that
War,</hi> p. 29. part 2.</note> had not been applied to any Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or
Patent in ſome months before the date of that pretended Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And
the Forgery plainly appeared at the Trial of Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> who,
at his Trial, and alſo at his Execution, though he was offered Pardon for
Life, and Reſtitution of his Eſtate, if he would own that he had a
Commiſſion from the King to Authorize what he had done, he affirmed
conſtantly, That he had no ſuch Commiſſion from the King, nor was his
Majeſty privy to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. This Relation is atteſted by Dr.
<hi>Ker</hi> Dean of <hi>Ardah,</hi> who was preſent at his Trial and
Execution, and affirms the ſame in a Letter printed <hi>Febr.</hi> 28. 1681.
a Copy of which I ſhall give you when I have told ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his
Confeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found a Patent of the Lord
<hi>Caulfield</hi>'s, when he ſeiz'd on <hi>Charlemount</hi>-Caſtle, to
which the Broad Seal was annexed, he cauſed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65960:120"/>to be drawn agreeable to his own purpoſe, and cauſed
that Broad Seal to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it, and ſo gave it out that he had the
King's Commiſſion for what he did.</p>
            <p>Now for the further clearing of the Royal Martyr from this foul
Imputation, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he had Intelligence from abroad, that great
Companies of Prieſts and Soldiers were from ſeveral Countries haſtening
into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that others from <hi>Ireland</hi> held
Correſpondence with divers Soldiers of that Nation then in Forreign Service,
which gave Suſpicion that there would be ſome Trouble in that Nation:
whereupon his Majeſty, in a Letter drawn by Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and
ſent to the Lords Juſtices in that Kingdom, charged them with great Care
and Diligence to ſecure themſelves againſt what was likely to happen; a

the Court urging the ſaid Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> to declare, why he did ſo

material proof that he had ſuch a Commiſſion from <hi>Charles

Affairs much more deſperate than it is, he would never redeem them by any
Conceſſion of ſo much wrong, both to his Honour and Conſcience. It is
for the defence of Religion principally that he hath undergone the Extremities
of War here, and he will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his Crown by ſacrificing it there. So
that to deal clearly with you, as you may be happy your ſelves, and be happy

if nothing will content you but what muſt wound his Honour and Conſcience,

            <p>There needs nothing more to be ſaid of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
being paſt doubt that <hi>Antrim</hi> had the King's Commiſſion for the
Iriſh firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, than what the King replied to that virulent
Remonſtrance of no farther Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>p.</hi> 289. of the <hi>Kings
Works,</hi> printed 1662. <hi>That if the Iriſh Rebellion can be juſtly
charged on the King, then I ſhall not blame any for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all the reſt

               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:65960:124"/>The Regicides in the laſt Charge againſt
the King, did not impute to him any hand in the firſt Inſurrection in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> but only his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Commiſſions to the Prince and
other Rebels, and to the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and to the Iriſh Rebels and
Revolters aſſociated with him. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> it ſeems could have
proved much more, that he gave a Commiſſion to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi> for that
War, wherein two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Proteſtants were ſlain.</p>
            <p>I am not ſo well read in the managing of that War, as to find
<hi>Antrim</hi> named, either as Commander, Counſellor, or Confederate,
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Ceſſation was treated of <hi>July</hi> 19, 1643. and the firſt
publick Imployment of <hi>Antrim</hi> was his being ſent with
<hi>Muskerry</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to the Queen, when the Confederate
Papiſts were in a low Condition, to deſire her and the Prince to
compaſſionate them, and reſtore them to their Protection, making many
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of their Duty, and applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his Majeſty's
Service; but this was when the King was in Priſon; and what rhey promiſed
for the King's Service, or what they performed, we find not. See

               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:65960:125"/>The Letter of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second,
printed in the Pamphlet called <hi>Truth brought to Light,</hi> which I
ſuppoſe is the ſame in that other Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, called <hi>Murder will

drawing ſome Forces to them for the ſervice of</hi> Scotland; <hi>and that
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Letters under the King's hand, they had ſufficient Evidence
and Teſtimony of ſeveral private Meſſages and Inſtructions from our
Royal Father, and from our Royal Mother,</hi> (N.B. This was probably in 1648.
when the King was like to be murdered, for then we find <hi>Antrim</hi> and
<hi>Muskerry</hi> were with the Queen and Prince in <hi>France</hi>) <hi>with
the privity and direction of the King our Father.</hi> So that this was done to
reduce the Papiſts to Obedience, and to draw ſome Forces for his Service,
he being then in Extremity. Suppoſing then that all this were true, of which
I doubt, becauſe <hi>Antrim</hi> ſtill adhered to the Pope's Nuncio, and
oppoſed <hi>Ormond;</hi> who can juſtly blame the King for imploying and
interfering one Rebel againſt another to ſave his Life. To conclude,
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Proteſtations of Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale, Muskerry,</hi> and
<hi>Mackguire,</hi> at the time of their deaths, denying that they knew of any
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the King's for raiſing or countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65960:125"/>that Iriſh Inſurrection, when if they had owned it
they might have ſaved their Lives and Eſtates, and the Regicides could not
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it in their Charge at his Trial, be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence of the
King's Innocency, yet his Majeſty's frequent Aſſeverations, ſolemn
Imprecations, and dying Proteſtations, make it paſt doubt, that Marqueſs
<hi>Antrim</hi> had not a Commiſſion from <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt for
rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or encouraging that bloody War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Two hundred thouſand
Proteſtants were murdered.</p>
            <p>When I firſt read this Relation of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, it
called to my mind that which the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>
ſaid concerning him, <hi>That he would die leaving his ſting in the wounds
of the Church;</hi> which he hath verifed in the Hiſtory of his Life. And I
may add, That he hath poured forth the very bottom of his Gaul to blacken the
Memory of the Royal Martyr. I cannot therefore let it paſs without ſome
Remarks upon it.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I conſidered what Authority he had for this Report,
and I found in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he quoted only a Pamphlet called <hi>Murther
will out;</hi> which was a ſcurrilous Libel, written, as is believed, by the
infamous <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> who was one of the King's Judges. Now to give ſome
colour to this Pamphlet, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> beſtows Notes of Admiration, as
that it is of <hi>great remark,</hi> and put him into <hi>Amazement,</hi> and
he ſeems to wonder how he ſhould forget<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65960:126"/>it in his
former Relation of that War. The Subſtance of the Relation is, That
<hi>Antrim</hi>'s Eſtate being ſequeſtred when <hi>Charles</hi> the
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was reſtored; and that having applied himſelf to <hi>Ormond,</hi>
and the Council in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they judged againſt him as a Rebel;
ſo that in all probability he had no Order or Commiſſion from
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt to produce: but coming into <hi>England,</hi> he
pleads to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, that he had his Father's Conſent and
Authority. For proof whereof the King referred his Cauſe to ſome of his
Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who, on Examination, found that he had his Fathers the King's
Conſent. But none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays the Letters were a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the firſt riſing; and probably the Plea which
<hi>Antrim</hi> then made, was grounded upon ſome Order which he had received
from <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt while confined, or from King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second whilſt he was yet but Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> for by
<hi>Burlace</hi>'s Relation, <hi>p.</hi> 199. the Confederate Catholicks being
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed by their Enemies, they ſent <hi>Antrim</hi> and
<hi>Muskerry</hi> to the Queen and the Prince in <hi>France,</hi> to take
Compaſſion of their miſerable Condition: and both the Queen and Prince
told them, <hi>That they would ſhortly ſend a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon qualified to treat
with them, who ſhould have power to give them whatever was requiſite to
their Security and Happineſs.</hi> And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Ireland</hi>
well ſatisfied with what was then granted them, which probably was very 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65960:126"/>large, the Prince being then wholly at his Mothers
diſpoſe; and how far the King might remember what Orders and
Conceſſions he had made them at that time, or ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, this
was that which prevailed for the reſtoring of <hi>Antrim</hi> to his
Eſtate, and not any Order from K.<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. But here it is
to be noted, that theſe things were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the Year 1648. when the
King was a cloſe Priſoner, and therefore no Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could be had
from him; much leſs is it like that he had given <hi>Antrim</hi> a
Commiſſion in the beginning of that War which was in 41, which was denied
by Sir <hi>Phelim O Neale,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Mackguire</hi> and
<hi>Muskerry,</hi> at their ſeveral Executions, and was never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by
any of the leading Papiſts in their Declarations or Confeſſions. Or if
they had pretended any ſuch Order or Commiſſion, who could believe any
reality or truth in it, when it is moſt certain, that the King did
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the Noble <hi>Ormond,</hi> as his Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, to manage that
War for his Proteſtant Subjects againſt thoſe bloody Rebels, which
continued for ſeveral years; which, as the good King complains in that
Twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, were to
repreſent him to the World as a Cyclopick Monſter, whom nothing would
ſerve to eat and drink but the Fleſh and Blood of his own Subjects,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:65960:127"/>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> adds, <hi>That</hi>
Antrim <hi>was forced to produce in Parliament a Letter of King</hi> Charles
<hi>the Firſt, by which he gave him order to take up Arms.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> is the firſt that I have heard or read to mention this
particular, and by the event it appears, that either there was never ſuch a
Letter produced, or what he pretended to be the King's Order and
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, was not for raiſing the firſt War, (for then doubtleſs
ſome of that Parliament, who had ingaged againſt the King in the late War,
would have been loud and clamorous enough, but they were all ſilent, and went
not a ſtep out of their way) but a Ceſſation being agreed on, ſome of
the Popiſh Party being beaten, and in fear of utter ruine, thought it more
eligible to joyn themſelves with my Lord <hi>Ormond,</hi> than become a Prey
to the Parliaments Army, who were reſolved on their utter Extirpation. This
was in the Year 1648. and then, for ought I know, he might have ſomething to
plead for himſelf with <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. I remember that there was
a Caſe brought into the Houſe of Peers, between the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi>
and the Lord of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> wherein the former was Accuſed by the
latter for the Ceſſation of Arms made by him, and his joyning with ſome
of the Papiſts, wherein the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> was acquitted by his
Peers. I have not the Caſe by me, but it will give much light to this
Affair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:65960:127"/>All the talk without doors, which Mr.
<hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſays was murmured by the People, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the
ſcandalous Suggeſtion of his inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Malice to that good King,
againſt whom he had been an active Enemy during that War; and would now
juſtifie himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon this late and falſe pretence, That the
King gave his Commiſſion to <hi>Antrim</hi> for that Inſurrection,
wherein Two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were ſlain.</p>
            <p>But that the Veracity of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of
Hiſtory may appear, I will ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reader one notorious Inſtance
which he produceth, <hi>p.</hi> 199. of the third part of his Life, in theſe
words—<hi>Many French Miniſters ſentenced to death and baniſhment,
came hither for refuge, and the Church-men relieve them not, becauſe they are
not for Engliſh Dioceſans and Conformity.</hi> Where I ſhall take notice
of the groſs falſhood of firſt the Matter of Fact; and ſecondly, of the
Reaſon and Occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to Matter of Fact, <hi>viz. That the Church-men did
not relieve thoſe French Miniſters, who being Sentenced to Death and
Baniſhment, fled hither for refuge;</hi> this is ſo loud a Lie as needs no
Bell to proclaim it. The Matter of Fact is ſo notoriouſly evident to the
contrary of what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> reports, that almoſt every Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in
<hi>England</hi> can diſprove it. The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>
did moſt affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compaſſionate their Caſe, and made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
proviſion for a great number of them,<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65960:128"/>as tenderly as a
Father could do for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He ſent down ſome into every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to the
ſeveral Biſhops to provide for them; in order whereto, ſeveral of thoſe
diſtreſſed Miniſters were fixed in beneficial Curacies. The Regiſter
for the Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi> hath Recorded the ſeveral Names of ſuch
French Miniſters as were Ordained by him to Exerciſe their Miniſtry in
the places hereafter mentioned. Mr. <hi>Johannis Jacobus Mauzino</hi> was
Ordained Presbyter to Officiate at <hi>Barnſtable, March</hi> 22. 1685. Mr.
<hi>Jacobus Sanxay</hi> Ordained Presbyter, and ſetled in the Pariſh-Church
of St. <hi>Olaves Exon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis Calvetus</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Johannis Gardian Giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> were both Ordained Presbyters. Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
Cauniers</hi> was Ordained Presbyter, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to a competent Benefice
called <hi>Eaſt-Budly</hi> in <hi>Devon, May</hi> 25. 1686. Mr. <hi>Peter
Pabouleus</hi> was Ordained and Setled at <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew
Coyaldus de Sante</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and Setled at <hi>Darmouth.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Lodovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Beenaudea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
Ordained and Setled at <hi>Biddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> Divers others, who had been
Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>London,</hi> were ſent hither and provided for. But how
great the number was which were Setled in and about <hi>London,</hi> and other
Dioceſſes, is too large to be inſerted here. Therefore Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s Affirmation, That the Church men relieved them not, is
notoriouſly falſe, and a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:65960:128"/>Secondly, Nor is the Reaſon which he gives
for their not relieving them leſs ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; <hi>for it was,</hi> ſaith
Mr. <hi>Baxter, becauſe they were not for Engliſh Dioceſans nor
Conformity:</hi> whereas all the Perſons above-named, did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to
Epiſcopal Ordination, and declared their Conformity; which accordingly they
did practiſe in their ſeveral Congregations, having the Engliſh Liturgy
tranſlated into French for that purpoſe. Could Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have
diſcovered ſo groſs a falſhood in any Writing of a Conformiſt, he
would have branded it with all the Notes of Infamy that his ſnarling
Rhetorick and Malice could have invented. But I ſhall make only this
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Calumny is one of the laſt
Periods in the cloſe of his written Life, which once more called to my
remembrance what the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> ſaid of Mr. <hi>Baxter,
That he would die leaving his ſting in the wounds of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where went the Charity of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and thoſe
liberal Friends who made him their Almoner? He tells us, <hi>That this did
begin and end at home to help the ſilenced Miniſters and the Poor.</hi>
Such Poor probably as frequented their Conventicles; for theſe are every
where the Objects of the Presbyterian Charity; though none boaſt more that
they are Men of Catholick and Univerſal Charity. But it was particularly
deſigned to increaſe the number of ſuch as followed them for their
Loaves.<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65960:129"/>Had any Man the opportunity to inſpect the
Subſcriptions of the ſeveral Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, and other
Dignitaries of the Church, as alſo of both the Univerſities, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the
Relief of the Refugees, he may find not only a bountiful Supply for the
preſent, but Proviſion made for their future Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as Brethren,
and profeſſed Members of the ſame Church, with us who want not the
countenance or incouragement of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Clergy to this day.</p>
            <p>My great Age and Infirmities (being now within one year as old as
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was at the time of his death) do enforce me to omit many
other Remarks of Pride, Hypocriſie, and Contradictions, which he that runs
may read in this and other Writings of our Author, which I leave to the
Obſervation of ſuch as better knew the Man and his Communication, and
ſhall make only this one Reflection more on his partiality in cenſuring the
Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts of all ſorts and degrees.</p>
            <p>And firſt, the Reader may ſee his hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commendations
of his Non-conforming Brethren, from <hi>p.</hi> 90. to <hi>p.</hi> 99. of his
Life, where he gives the Character of ſuch of the Eighteen hundred ſilenced
Miniſters as were his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, not ſpeaking by hearſay but perſonal
acquaintance, which were between Forty and Fifty, beſides many whom he had
forgotten; and about Forty <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, with Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Independants; and others of ſeveral parts<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65960:129"/>that were
Fellow-ſufferers with himſelf. All which, if they deſerved the Titles
which he gives them, he might have Canonized them as Saints in Heaven, on
better grounds than he hath done by <hi>Brooks, Pym,</hi> and <hi>White</hi> in
his <hi>Saints Everlaſting Rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Lay-Brethren of the Separation, he gives the
preheminence to thoſe of his own Flock at <hi>Kidderminſter:</hi> And p.
85. part 1. he ſays, <hi>Some of the poor Men did competently underſtand
the Body of Divinity, and were able to judge in difficult Controverſies; and
ſo able in Prayer, that few Miniſters did match them in order and
fulneſs, in apt Expreſſions and holy Oratory with fervency.</hi> And of
<hi>Six hundred Communicants,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had there, he
ſays, <hi>there were not above Twelve of whom he had not good hopes of their
Sincerity.</hi> And this he imputes to his own Labours; <hi>For before I came
thither, there was about one Family in a Street that worſhipped God, and
called on his Name; but before I came away, there was not past one Family in
the ſide of a Street that did not ſo,</hi> p. 88, 89. And he adds this
reaſon of their proficiency, <hi>That being Weavers, they could ſet a Book
before them, ſtanding in their Looms, and edifie one another by reading or
talking.</hi> Of ſuch Trades-men and Freeholders, he ſays, <hi>that they
are the ſtrength of Religion and Civility in the Land;</hi> though ſuch
made up the Mob which begun and continued our Wars, and deſtroyed our
Religion by dividing it into<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65960:130"/>innumerable Sects and
Factions. So that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> obſerved in his <hi>Gangreena,</hi>
that in the ſpace of four years after that Epiſcopacy was laid aſide,
there were more Hereſies ſtarted in this Land, than had been known in the
Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church from the foundation thereof.</p>
            <p>As to his Cenſures of ſuch as lived in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the
eſtabliſhed Religion, he is as impartial as Death, condemning them all as a
prophane and perſecuting Generation, in a Book called <hi>Cain and Abel:</hi>
How he hath branded the beſt of our Kings and the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, hath been already
ſhewn: How he Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Parliament and their Laws, which he calls
<hi>the tearing Engines that woried Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Miniſters, caſting them
out of their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into Poverty and Priſons to ſtarve and
pine away; and for impoſing ſuch Oaths, Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Declarations,
as any Man that feared God could not comply with,</hi> is ſuch a Common
Place, that I wonder it was no more taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
            <p>After this Cenſure of the Parliament, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
ſpeaks of the Nobility and Gentry in general, <hi>p.</hi> 134. where he
ſaith, <hi>I more than ever lament the unhappineſs of the Nobility and
Gentry, and great Ones of the World, who live in ſuch temptations to
Senſuality, Curioſity, and Waſting of Time about a multitude of little
things, whoſe Lives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>re too often
a Tranſcript of the Sins of</hi> Sodom, <hi>Pride, Fulneſs of Bread, and
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Idleneſs, and want of Compaſſion to<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65960:130"/>the Poor.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 89. <hi>That Gentlemen and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
and Servile Tenants are the ſtrength of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in the Land;</hi> though it
was not very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to put the Beggar on the Gentleman, yet it was much worſe
to joyn them in the Bonds of Iniquity, and make the Compariſon between them
and the Trades-men ſo odious, that theſe are reputed the ſtrength of
Religion and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but the Gentry and their Tenants and Beggars, the
ſtrength of Iniquity. And he inſtanceth in Sir <hi>R. Clare</hi> and Sir
<hi>John Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi> who much hindred his Succeſs in gathering
Proſelytes in <hi>Kidderminſter.</hi> He gives this Character of Sir <hi>R.
Clare,</hi> p. 94. part 1. <hi>That he was an old Man of great Courtſhip and
Civility, very temperate as to Diet, Apparel, and Sports; ſeldom ſwore any
louder than by his troth; one that ſhewed him much perſonal reverence and
reſpect beyond his deſerts, and converſed with love and familiarity. One
that ſent his Family to be Catechiſed and perſonally Inſtructed, which
ſwayed with the worſt among that People to do the like.</hi> But being
ruled by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> he liked not of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Preciſeneſs and Extemporary Prayer, and abſtained from the Sacrament,
which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> delivered to ſuch as ſate or ſtood at the
receiving it, which gave offence to Sir <hi>R. Clare: whereby</hi> (he ſays)
<hi>Sir</hi> R.C. <hi>did more to hinder his Succeſs than a multitude of
others could have done.</hi> And on ſuch an account all the Conforming Gentry
are the ſtrength of Iniquity. And although <pb n="218" facs="tcp:65960:131"/>the Poverty
of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s People, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Maſter-workmen lived but little
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their Journey-men, from hand to mouth, <hi>p.</hi> 94. was a help
to his Succeſs: the Poor receiving <hi>the glad tidings of the Goſpel,</hi>
and being uſually <hi>rich in faith.</hi> Yet for thoſe that frequent the
Churches and Common Prayer, they are coupled with the Gentry, as the
ſtrengtheners of Iniquity; whereas the Laws have provided ſuch a Competency
for their Maintenance, as may keep them from begga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which the Law alloweth
not: but in truth the multitude of Beggars in occaſioned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by
thoſe many Families that depend upon the Trade of Weaving, who living but
from hand to mouth, are forced, on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Trade for a few Weeks, to beg
for their Subſiſtance, or to do worſe; of which ſuch places as abound
with Men of that Calling have ſad experience. I have enlarged this Remark on
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Charity, becauſe, as an Errour in the Foundation, it
runs through the whole Narrative of his Life, and as a Root of bitterneſs,
invenometh all that it brings forth. What Credit can his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of
Endeavours for Love and Peace, and his Pleas for Concord obtain, when he will
allow of no other way of Concord but what he himſelf fancied, and all
Chriſtian Churches have condemned? I only intreat the Reader of this, or Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s Deſcription of his Life, to carry in his mind thoſe
properties of<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65960:132"/>Chriſtian Charity, mentioned in 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 4, 5, 6 and 7th Verſes. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long, and
is kind. Charity envieth not, vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up. Doth
not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rejoyceth in the
truth. Beareth all things, believeth all things, endureth all things.</hi> And
then apply theſe Rules, as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>That
though one ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels; though he have the Gift
of Propheſy, and underſtand all Myſteries, and all Knowledge; and though
he have all Faith, ſo that he could remove Mountains; and though he beſtow
all his Goods to feed the Poor, and have not Charity, it profiteth
nothing.</hi> And as St. <hi>James,</hi> chap. 1. V. 4. <hi>If any man
ſeemeth to be righteous, and bridleth not his Tongue, that man's Religion is
vain.</hi>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Find that in a Book of yours, defending Schiſm against Mr.
<hi>Hales,</hi> on pretence of oppoſing it, you were pleaſed to think many
paſſages in my Writings worthy of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65960:133"/>to
your ends; I thank you that you choſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words for peace, which ſome may
make a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of than your ſelf: But I think, if you had referred Men
to my own Books to read them, with what goeth before and after, they would have
been more eaſily underſtood. I underſtand by your Book that you think
that you are in the right, which is the most that I have yet learned out of it;
unleſs it be alſo that you think the Non-conformists be not yet hated and
afflicted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; or that he that <hi>ſweareth</hi> must aſcend by
treading upon him that feareth an <hi>Oath?</hi> I am in ſome doubt lest you
have wronged our Prelacy, by ſo openly proclaiming the Enmity of ſo great a
Man as <hi>Hales</hi> against them, and by enticing Men by your noiſe to read
his Book, which you contradict; which if they de, I doubt your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
will not ſave them from the Light. But the reaſon of my troubling you with
theſe Lines, is only to crave ſome ſatisfaction about two or three
Matiers of Fact in your Book, which would ſeem ſtrange to me, did I not
find ſuch things too common in Invectives againſt ſilenced Miniſters;
and did I not know that it is part of Satan's work to perſwade the World,
that no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory hath any certainty of Truth, that ſo Sacred Hiſtory may
be diſadvantaged.</p>
               <p n="1">I. One is in theſe words, <hi>p.</hi> 110. <hi>When they
had in the grand Debate given in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the Liturgy, ſome of
the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had prepared another Form, but a great part of their Brethren
objected many things<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65960:134"/>againſt that; and never as yet did
(as I hear of) agree upon any other, nor I think ever will.</hi> I crave the
juſtice of you to tell us, which was that you call the Grand Debate? and who
thoſe were that diſſented? or what proof you have of any ſuch things?
Either you know what you ſay, or not? If not, and yet publiſh it in ſuch
a manner, while you are accuſing others of ſin? What is this to be called?
If you did, it is yet far worſe. Either you ſpeak of the
<hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Aſſembly, which made the Directory; or of the
Commiſſioners in 1660. Not the firſt ſure; for none I think was yet
ever vain enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they thus drew up another Liturgy. It muſt
needs be the later: of which this is paſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial by any but the—1.
That the King's Commiſſion under the Broad Seal, authorized us to make
ſome <hi>[additional Forms].</hi> 2. The late Archbiſhop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> when we came according to
appointment, to try by friendly Conference, what Alterations each Party might
yield to for our deſired Concord, without any injury to their Conſciences,
began with a Declaration, <hi>That we being the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs, they would no
further proceed to treat with us, till we had given them in entirely in
writing, 1. What we blamed in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; and our Reaſons of it. 2. And
what we deſired as better.</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> and others <hi>ſaid,
[This was plainly to deny the Conference which we were Commiſſioned
for.]</hi> And they would have broke off, had it not been for me,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65960:134"/>who requeſted them rather to yield, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it,
than give them occaſion to charge us with Tergiverſation and Refuſal of
any lawful thing; though I eaſily ſaw that the Motioner thought thereby to
break us, as diſagreeing when we came to perform the undertaking. While
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drew up their Exceptions againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, they appointed me to
draw up the <hi>Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Forms.</hi> But remembring the Biſhops <hi>[what
we deſired inſtead]</hi> I drew up a <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi> It muſt needs be
very imperfect, being done (in neceſſary haſte) in eight days. Dr.
<hi>Reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> only thought that we ſhould be blamed for offering a
whole Liturgy inſtead of <hi>Additional Forms.</hi> I told him firſt, It
was but to be added to the old, if reformed. 2. And they might cut off all that
they thought ſuperfluous upon Debate, even all that the Biſhops ſhould
except juſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; for we did but offer it to them, profeſſing we
were ready to alter any thing upon their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Hereupon Dr.
<hi>Reignolds</hi> yielded, and it was often read over among us; only the
Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the King being thought too long, Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> was appointed
to draw up a ſhorter, which he did; all the reſt ſtanding as I wrote it:
It was agreed to without one diſſenting voice: Nor had we one Objection
ſent us in by any other. I was appointed at a meeting with the Biſhops at
the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> at once to deliver them <hi>this Liturgy,</hi> a <hi>Reply
to their Anſwer to our Exceptions,</hi> and a <hi>Petition for Peace and
Concord;</hi> all which they had appointed me to draw up, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined 
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65960:135"/>and conſented to. We waited for an Anſwer to all, and
never had an anſwer to any one of them; but they kept them, and ſaid
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them. I was eſpecially deſirous to have heard their Exceptions
againſt our Liturgy (where they thought we would have diſagreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our
ſelves) and urged ſome of them to it, and could never get a word of
Anſwer or Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which made me wonder; as well knowing, 1. How very
willing ſome were to have found it faulty: 2. And how hard it is, in
neceſſitated haſte, to write ſuch a thing that ſhall not be liable to
many Exceptions. Yea, when <hi>Roger L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange</hi> after wrote againſt
us, he ſaith little at all againſt the Liturgy, ſave that we left men at
too much liberty. To which we then ſaid, <hi>That impoſing and
reſtraining was not our work, but the Biſhops;</hi> who, we ſuppoſed
upon debate, would have too much done it. Now if this <hi>full Concord,</hi>
and no <hi>Anſwer</hi> or <hi>Exceptions</hi> from them that extorted this
Work from us, be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Report you make; or if you have here dealt
like a Miniſter of Truth, I pray you help me to diſcern it. The Book, with
the reſt, was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long ago; moſt of them by ſome poor Scrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that being uſed in tranſcribing, had got a Copy, and did it for gain.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another paſſage is <hi>p.</hi> 293. <hi>No
ſinful act being required to make Miniſterial Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unlawful (which
if there had been, they or ſome other would and ought to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it, and then, I doubt not, it would<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65960:135"/>by Authority have been
taken away; but that being not done</hi>—Here I deſire you to
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me in a few things: 1. When even our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reply and
foreſaid Petition againſt the old Conformity, were never anſwered to this
day, is it ingenious to take this for a Confutation, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay <hi>[It
is not done?]</hi> Should I ſay <hi>[It was never yet diſcovered that
Epiſcopacy is lawful]</hi> would you not have called me—as long as
<hi>Saravia, Bilſon, Hooker,</hi> &amp;c. are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered? 2. Do you not
know what abundance of old have thought they diſcovered the ſinfulneſs of
Conformity (<hi>Bradſhaw, Nicols, Ames, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Jacob, Cartwright,</hi>
&amp;c.) and what <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, Salmaſius, Gerſom, Bucer, Didoclave,</hi>
&amp;c. have written againſt Prelacy; and ſome of late againſt our
Conformity, (<hi>Cawdry, Hickman,</hi> and others yet unanſwered) And is this
your dry Denial a rational Confutation? 3. Would not your words make the
ignorant believe that we have the liberty of the Preſs, and may do it if we
will: and do not the Act of Parliament, and the ſeveral Searches of the
Preſs, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters refuſal, ſhew how falſe ſuch an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is? It may be ſome ſmall Pamphlet may, with much ado, creep out; but ſo
cannot any thing that is full and ſatisfactory? Our Cauſe is a meer
ſtranger to our Accuſers; (it ſeems even to ſuch as you) becauſe we
cannot have leave to print it: A few have heretofore, when the watch was leſs
ſtrict, got ſomewhat out, to little purpoſe (Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi>'s was
beyond Sea) but nothing<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65960:136"/>that may make us well
underſtood. And is it fit work for a Miniſter to blame men thus publickly
for not doing Impoſſibilites? 4. It muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that you know
theſe things: 1. That the Law forbids us to deprave or ſpeak againſt the
Liturgy upon grievous Penalties. 2. That the Canon excommunicates us <hi>ipſo
facto,</hi> that is, <hi>ſine Sententia Judicis,</hi> if we do but ſay that
there is any thing that a man may not with a good Conſcience conform to. 3.
And that our preſent Governours are againſt it. 4. And that for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it
we are ſure by Conformiſts to be called Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to Authority, and
Seditious. 5. And that we are ſo accuſed by you commonly for preaching when
forbidden, which is as much our vowed duty ſure as writing. And do you now
tell us, <hi>That we ought to diſcover it if there be any ſinful act
commanded?</hi> Will you warrant us againſt the Charge of Diſobedience, or
do you drive us on that, which if we do, you know we are already judged to
Excommunication, Jails and Ruine? We have long begg'd of Parliament men, that
we might but once have leave to ſpeak for our ſelves (which we never had as
to the new Conformity to this day) and that we might peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſuch
leave; and they tell us theſe fifteen Years almoſt, There is no hope: it
will but ruine you. I have offered two of the moſt eminent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to beg
it of them, or any, on my knees, that we might but once publiſh the Caſe
and Reaſons of our Diſſent: And is it not enough to be fifteen or
ſixteen Years ejected, ſilenced, ſcorned, accuſed<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65960:136"/>as unworthy to be endured, and to be ſilently pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and never
anſwer for our ſelves, nor have the common juſtice of being heard, but we
muſt have the additional abuſe, to be told that <hi>we ought to do it?</hi>
Yea, many of the Conformiſts (O with what face!) have publiſhed to the
World, that we take not the things which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe for <hi>ſins,</hi> or
dare not ſay ſo of them; when even the far eaſier Conformity 1660. we did
by word and writing declare to be ſinful, and in our Petition for Peace
(printed) proteſted, That did we not take it to be ſinful, and hazarding
our Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhould never have ſtuck at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to
them. And it is no ſmall number of ſins ſo heinous which we ſuppoſe
ſince impoſed, that we dare not ſo much as name them, leaſt we
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe you, and make you ſay, that we render the Conformiſts ſuch
heinous ſinners! But I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your Authority when any of us are next
blamed for diſcovering the heinous ſinfulneſs of Conformity, as we yet
believe it would be to us. If you ſay that the Licenſers would licenſe
our Writings if we did it with ſobriety; 1. You know that the Canon and Law
is againſt it. 2. I ſhall then in juſtice challenge you to make it good,
I here promiſe you an account of my Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when ever you will
procure it licenſed. 3. And which way got you ſo ſtrong a faith, as to be
paſt doubt, <hi>That did we diſcover any ſinfulneſs, it would by
Authority have been taken away.</hi> Make this true yet, (after near Two
thouſand Miniſter have been near ſixteen years ejected 
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65960:137"/>and ſilenced, and many killed by impriſonment, and
the People of the Land divided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted by the tearing Engines) and
you ſhall have the honour of being the greateſt healer of our breaches that
ever roſe in the days of my remembrance. But if it be not true—</p>

throughout. Theſe are great things to be ſpoken ſo boldly. 1. Do you
ſuppoſe your Reader one that never read Church Hiſtory? What work the
Biſhops made for <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> for <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> for the
<hi>Eutychians</hi> und <hi>Acephalites,</hi> againſt <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
Chryſoſtom,</hi> &amp;c. for the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> about the <hi>Tria
Capitula,</hi> for Images, againſt Emperours and Kings, ſetting up the
Pope, and decreed the depoſition of all Princes that obey him not, and making
Loyalty to be <hi>Haereſis Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riciana:</hi> How the River <hi>Orontes</hi>
at <hi>Antioch</hi> hath been coloured with the Blood, and the Graves of the
Monks and People, that fought it out in the ſtreets for the ſeveral
Biſhops? What work they made at the firſt Council at <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
the firſt and ſecond at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Council at
<hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> and many another? How many Ages they were, and yet are the
Army of the Pope, to ſubdue Princes and Nations, Truth and Juſtice, and
ſet up the Evil that now reigneth in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World? How even
againſt the Pope's will they made the beſt King and Emperour <hi>Lodovic.
Pius,</hi> as a Penance, reſign his Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the Altar to a
Rebel Son, and ſent him to Priſon? He that ever read but <hi>Baronius,
Binius,</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:65960:137"/>or other Epiſcopal Hiſtory, will pity
you. Can you name one Presbyter for very many Biſhops, that have been the
Heads or Fomenters of Hereſie, Schiſm or Rebellion? And yet Presbyters were
more in number than Biſhops? <hi>Innumerable Biſhops,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Binius, were in the</hi> Monothelite <hi>Council under</hi> Philippicus. Of
all things that ever befel the Chriſtian Church, I ſcarce know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing
comparable in ſhame and miſchievous effects, to the horrid
Perfidiouſneſs, Contention, Schiſm and Pride of Biſhops; Curſing one
year by hundreds all that were of one Opinion; and another year all that were
of the contrary, as the Times and Intereſt and Emperours changed. And if
<hi>Arius</hi> or <hi>Novatus, Aerius</hi> and <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> (which are
all you name were the beginners of any Schiſm, how many hundred Biſhops
were the promoters of them all, ſave that of <hi>Aerius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
themſelves? And is it any honour to Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, that <hi>Arius,</hi> and
<hi>Aerius</hi> (an Arian) were not Biſhops, when they are ſaid to be
Seekers of Biſhopricks, and to divide becauſe they could not obtain them?
Sure they were Prelatical Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters: What honour were it to Epiſcopacy
that you are no Biſhop, if all theſe, and ſuch things, were vended by you
in hope of a Biſhoprick, or ſome Preferment? <hi>I will never whilſt I
breathe truſt a Bresbyter that ſets himſelf to get Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, no more
than I will truſt a</hi>—But did you know, or did you not, that as for
<hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Novatian,</hi> one of them was an ill choſen
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65960:138"/>of
his Prelacy? And that as for <hi>Donatus,</hi> there were two of them; one of
them a Biſhop: and that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> Schiſm was meerly and
baſely Prelatical, even whether their Biſhop or <hi>Cecilianus</hi>
ſhould carry it? and that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing and re-ordaining, and Schiſm,
was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they took none to have power that had it not from their
Biſhop, as being the right? (like our re-ordainers.) And are theſe
Inſtances to prove what you aſſert? Were it not for entering upon an
unpleaſing and unprofitable task, I would ask you, 1. Who that
<hi>Juncto</hi> of Presbyters was that dethroned the King? was it they that
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned and proteſted againſt it? 2. Whether it was not an Epiſcopal
Parliament (forty to one, if not an hundred) that began the War againſt the
King? 3. Whether the General and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army, twenty to one, were
not Conformiſts? 4. Whether the Major-Generals in the Counties were not
almost all Epiſcopal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts? (The Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> was over
your Country.) 5. Whether the Admiral and Sea-Captains were not almoſt
Epiſcopal Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts? (As <hi>Heylin</hi> diſtinguiſheth them of
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi>'s mind diſliking Arminianiſm, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 6. Whether the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> were not the
Parliaments Major-General? 7. Whether the Epiſcopal Gentry did not more of
them take the Engagement (and many Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Miniſters) than the
Presbyterians? 8. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if this Parliament, which made the Acts of
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity and Conventicles, ſhould quarrel<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65960:138"/>with the
King, it would prove them to be Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and Non-conformiſts? 9.
Whether the Presbyterian Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> did not write more againſt the Regicides and
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, and declare againſt them, than all the Conformiſts, or as
much? And the Long Parliament was forced, and moſt of them caſt out, before
the King could be deſtroyed. And when they were reſtored, it made way for
his Reſtoration. And Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> Lord Mayor, and the City of
<hi>London's</hi> inviting Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk</hi> from the Rump into the City,
and joyning with him, was the very day that turned the Scales for the King. But
all theſe are Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fitter for your better Conſideration than our

heartily deſire, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Propoſal, great care may be taken
to ſuppreſs private Conceptions of Prayer, leſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinions be made
the Matter of Prayer in publick, is it hath and will be, if private Perſons
take liberty to make publick Prayers.</hi> And on ſecond thoughts, I find you
to agree with them, <hi>p.</hi> 201. of the <hi>Cure of Diviſions,</hi> in
theſe words; <hi>Every Separatiſt, Anabaptiſt, Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, doth too
willingly put his Errours into his Prayers.</hi> On which words Mr. <hi>Bag
ſhaw</hi> in his <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 7. doth thus Paraphraſe; <hi>By
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of Separatiſts as a diſtinct Body of Men from the Antinomians,
Quakers and Anabaptiſts, it is evident he can mean no other but his
Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian and Congregational Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I have noted by the way, that what I ſaid of his
Brethrens diſſenting from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Liturgy (as he calls it) may not
ſeem ſtrange, ſeeing he ſo far differs from it himſelf; 
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65960:140"/>for there he gives liberty to all Miniſters to Pray and
Exhort, as they think fit: and here he declares againſt the Inconveniencies
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>I thank you that you choſe any words
of mine for Peace, which ſome may make a better uſe of than your ſelf.
But I think if you had referred Men to my own Books to read what goeth before,
and after, they would have been more eaſily underſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They that read your words, which I have for the
moſt part quoted, and heartily deſire them to peruſe, ſhall find, that
I did not wreſt, or miſreport them. But in truth, if Men ſhall read your
Actions before and after, they would find a great diſparity between them and
your Words. And if I had ſhewn any fowl dealing in my Quotations, why did you
not deal ſo fairly as to give one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>I underſtand by your Book that you
think that you are in the right, which is the moſt that I have learned out of
it; unleſs it be alſo, that you think the Non-conformiſts be not yet
hated and afflicted enough; or that, he that ſweareth, muſt aſcend by
treading upon him that feareth an Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am the more confirmed that I am in the right,
becauſe you ſay nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of my Errour, for which I ſhould
have thanked you. And if you have learned nothing by my Book, you may thank
your ſelf; ſome Men muſt unlearn a great deal,<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65960:140"/>before they are capable of learning any thing againſt their
Prejudices and Intereſts. That I think the Non-conformiſts not hated and
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flcted enough, is more than you can learn from my Book; and I challenge you
to ſhew any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage there tending to the puniſhment of
Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, equal to that, which your own Principles ſuggeſt: For
you ſay, <hi>The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate will quickly find that the Diſtractions of
the Church will quickly breed, and feed ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions in the
Commonwealth, as may make them wiſh they had quenched the fire while it was
yet quenchable. The fire that began in the Church, may, if let alone, reach the
Court,</hi> p. 209. of <hi>Confirm.</hi> You objected the like to another
mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Antagoniſt, <hi>p.</hi> 160. <hi>Sacril. Deſertion; What good
will our Sufferings do you? Do you feel your ſelves ever the more at liberty
when we are in the Common Goals? Are you the fuller when ſome
Non-conformiſts want bread? but upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information you ſaw cauſe
then, and may now, to retract that obloquy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that other Inſinuation that you ſhould learn from me,
<hi>That he that ſweareth muſt aſcend by treading upon him that feareth
an Oath,</hi> you came too late to learn it out of my Book: If it had been
there, the ſwearing to the Covenant taught that Leſſon perfectly, how to
aſcend into their places that feared that unlawful Oath. Our lawful
Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons injure no Man. Pray where did you learn to load the Conforming
Miniſtry with a<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65960:141"/>Charge of Perjury, Perfidiouſneſs,
and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, greateſt, and covenanting never in certain Points to obey
Chriſt againſt the World and the Fleſh, as you too plainly inſinuate
<hi>p.</hi> 74. of <hi>Sacr. Deſertion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>I am in ſome doubt, leſt you have
wronged our Prelacy, by ſo openly proclaiming the enmity of ſo great a Man
as</hi> Hales <hi>againſt them, and by inticing Men by your noiſe to read
his Book, which you contradict: which if they do, I doubt that your Confutation
will not ſave them from the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am out of doubt why Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> is
accounted ſo great a Man with you, <hi>(viz.)</hi> for oppoſing our
Prelacy; and I perceive you practice the ſame way of growing popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. But
the reading that Book of mine, (which if it have not anſwered Mr.
<hi>Hales</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, yet ſhews how he confuted them himſelf, when
in his later days he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconciled to that Sacred Function, and
died as a Martyr in its Communion) cannot prejudice our Prelacy). He had indeed
a fit of diſtempered Zeal, as other good Men may, but it was not hectical and
inveterate: He had a ſtrong Brain and ſound Vitals, which reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him
to a better Judgment; and that is all the hurt I wiſh you. But I pray Sir,
when you ſay, That I defend Schiſm; had not you ſuch a Notion as Mr.
<hi>Hales,</hi> That the Biſhops, who endeavour Conformity, are
Schiſmatical.<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65960:141"/>I find <hi>p.</hi> 29. of your <hi>Sacril.
Deſertion,</hi> that you call them the Sect of the Dioceſan Prelates; and
Schiſm in Fact, muſt lye on them, or you, and thoſe of your
Perſwaſion; who declare, <hi>That upon juſt Reaſons you diſſent
from the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hierarchy or Prelacy diſclaimed in Covenant, as
it was ſtated and exerciſed in theſe Kingdoms,</hi> p. 5. of your firſt
Paper to the King. But your juſt Reaſons for ſo doing are ſtill in the
dark. Reaſons indeed you ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, as well againſt the <hi>Primitive
Biſhops,</hi> in your <hi>Hiſtory of Biſhops</hi> throughout, as
againſt <hi>our Prelacy:</hi> But oh! with what Injuſtice, with how much
Malice are they inſinuated! The <hi>Grotian</hi> Biſhops (as you term them)
were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Religion, animating the haters of Piety, and driving
Multitudes out of the Land, the moſt of them, twenty for one, being
Conformiſts, <hi>Preface to Grotian Religion.</hi> So that it was ſafer in
all places that ever you knew, for Men to live in conſtant Swearing,
Curſing, and Drunkenneſs, than to inſtruct a Man's Family on the Lord's
Day, <hi>p.</hi> 109. And again, <hi>p.</hi> 113, 114. Should one of you
<hi>(i.e.)</hi> of the Epiſcopal Clergy, pretend to be the Biſhop of a
Dioceſs, you would have a ſmall Clergy, and none of the beſt; and the
People in moſt of the Pariſhes, that are moſt ignorant, drunken,
prophane, and unruly, with ſome civil Perſons of your mind, who would be
inconſiderable in the Croud of the ungodly: for the cauſe of their Love to
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy,<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65960:142"/>is, becauſe it was a ſhadow, if not a
ſhelter, to the Prophane heretofore; ſo that the Prelatical Church would be
in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon account, near kin to an Ale-houſe or Tavern, to ſay no
worſe. Thus have you poured out as much Contempt upon that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Order, as
ſo ſlender a Veſſel could hold. But none of this Filth will ſtick
upon it, with thoſe that can remember, The Agreement that was in the
Worſhip of God, the ſolemn San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Sabbaths, the
diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and puniſhing of Vice, the Love and Charity among
Neighbours, which I my ſelf do yet remember in this City, where I had my
Education under that happy Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our late unhappy Wars; all which
Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we do now again in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure enjoy. And if this be
the way which you call Schiſm, I do reſolve, by the Grace of God, living
and dying, ſo to worſhip the God of my Fathers; nor will any but a
Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt account me a Schiſmatick for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>But the reaſon of troubling you with
theſe Lines, is only to crave ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction about two or three
Matters of Fact in your Book, which would ſeem ſtrange to me, did I not
find ſuch things too common in Invectives againſt the ſilenced
Miniſters; and did I not know, that it is part of Satan's work, to perſwade
the World that no Hiſtory hath any certainty of Truth, that ſo Sacred
Hiſtory may be diſadvantaged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:65960:142"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How ſtrange ſoever
the Matters of Fact may ſeem to you, I doubt not but they will appear to be
true to the indifferent Reader: but that I have acted the part of Satan, to
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World that no Hiſtory is true, that ſo I might
diſadvantage Sacred Hiſtory, is moſt untrue: Nor have you (becauſe you
could not) mentioned any Inſtance that might colour it. But thus you dealt
with Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truly quoted and applied a Paſſage of
Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s in his <hi>Appendix</hi> to you, <hi>p.</hi> 254.
you told him, <hi>That he could not have uttered more falſhood if the Devil
had dictated to him.</hi> That my Book is an Invective againſt ſilenced
Miniſters, is already anſwered: That I am guilty of depraving
Eccleſiaſtical or Sacred Hiſtory, needs no anſwer, becauſe there is
no Charge. How notoriouſly you are guilty of this Crime, I ſhall ſhew in
an inſtance or two, beſides that wherein you abuſe the Primitive
Biſhops; of which hereafter. <hi>Shew me,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, in
Scripture or Hiſtory, that either there was ever</hi> de facto, <hi>or ought
to be</hi> de jure, <hi>ſuch a thing in the World as the Papiſts call the
Church, and I profeſs I will immediately turn Papiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was ſome ground for them that then
ſaid you were one, to think ſo of you: For what is more plain in Church
Hiſtory, than that there was <hi>de facto</hi> ſuch a Church, as the
Papiſts call the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> one thouſand years together, and
which hath been<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65960:143"/>acknowledged by Learned Men of your
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; and if we may not believe this, how ſhall we believe there
was any Church at all at <hi>Rome</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days. But Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded that there is any ſuch thing as the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> p. 35. of his <hi>Sacr. Deſertion.</hi> I would
give him all the Money in my Purſe, to make me underſtand what the Church
of <hi>England</hi> is, and yet our Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hiſtories will ſhew
that we have had the face and form of a Church among us before the days of the
Conquerour. The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians did acknowledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to
be a true Church, <hi>Divine Right,</hi> p. 265. Will not you allow ſo much
to the Church of <hi>England?</hi> The old Non-conformiſts general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted
it: And <hi>Ruthband</hi> ſays all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches acknowledge the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to be their Siſter. And you ſay, <hi>p.</hi>
263, 264. That almoſt all the Chriſtian World is worſe than it.—And
if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Communion with ſuch a Church, there hath been no Church to
Communicate with theſe Thouſand years. We are more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr.
<hi>John Goodwin,</hi> who ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 26. of his <hi>Sion Colledge
viſited,</hi> That there was more of the Truth and Power of Godlineſs in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under the Prelatical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than in all
the Reformed Churches beſide. And if Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> ſay true, you
have had Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all its Ordinances.
It is then a Church, and a true Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:65960:143"/>The ſecond Inſtance is concerning
Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for though you cannot be ignorant that our Saviour did kneel at his
Prayers, and do confeſs that kneeling at Prayers was in uſe in the
Apoſtles time, <hi>p.</hi> 110. of <hi>Grand Debate;</hi> and that it hath
been practiſed in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, ever ſince that Kings were its
Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers, yet from an occaſional and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Conſtitution of
the Church, reſtrained to the Lord's days throughout the Year, and to Week
days only between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,</hi> and applied
only to the duty of Prayer, not receiving of the Lord's Supper, (which you make
different Actions, and ſay we are not to be in the Act of Praying, when we
are in the Act of Receiving) from this temporary limited Order which they
thought fit to continue only till the People were confirmed in the belief of
the Reſurrection, you tell your <hi>Kidderminſters,</hi> That it is
againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the General Councils, and many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years Practice
of the Church, to kneel in the Act of Receiving on the Lord's day. Whereas you
might with more probability have applied it againſt kneeling at Prayers, if
there be now any obligation in that Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it holds much more
againſt ſitting, which was never practiſed in the Primitive Church,
though you plead moſtly for it. And you add, <hi>All knew that my judgment
ever was for the lawfulneſs of kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Defence of
Brinc. p. 34. And ſo you<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65960:144"/>told the Epiſcopal Party,
<hi>That you would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kneel than diſturb the Peace of the Church, or be
deprived of its Communion.</hi> Whereby, as the Biſhop of
<hi>Worceſter</hi> inferred, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that kneeling at the Sacrament is
not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and that not to kneel, when required, is to diſturb the Peace
of the Church; and that the impoſing it upon penalty of being deprived of the
Communion, is an effectual means to make thoſe that otherwiſe would not
kneel, to conform to it; and conſequently the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it is not unlawful.
But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays in his <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> Part 2.
p. 111. Q. 3. Sect. 40. ſays, <hi>For kneeling, I never heard any thing yet
to prove it unlawful; if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, it muſt be either ſome word
of God, or the nature of the Ordinance, which is ſuppoſed to be
contradicted. But</hi> (1.) <hi>there is no word of God for any geſture, nor
againſt any. Chriſt's Example can never be proved to oblige us more in
this, than in many other Circumſtances that are confeſt not obligatory; as,
that he delivered but to Miniſters; and but to a Family; to Twelve; and after
Supper; on a Thurſday night; and in an upper Room,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And his
geſture was not ſuch a ſitting as ours. And (2ly.) for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the
Ordinance, it is mixt. And if it be lawful to take a Pardon from the King upon
our knees, I know not what can make it unlawful to take a ſealed Pardon from
Chriſt (by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador) upon our knees.</hi> Now if you knew not what
might make it unlawful to receive<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65960:144"/>the Sacrament kneeling,
when you wrote your <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> which was long after your
Diſputation with the Biſhops at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> you did not very
adviſedly urge with ſo much heat, That the requiring Communicants to
receive it kneeling under ſuch Penalties, was a ſinful impoſition. What?
to receive a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from Chriſt upon our knees, this could not be ſinful
in the Receiver, nor could it be ſinful in the Impoſer: For there being
nothing ſaid by our Saviour concerning the Geſture, he hath left that to
the determination of the Church. And if the Church may determine of the place
and time of Publick Worſhip, becauſe they are not determined by Chriſt,
why may it not determine of particular Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures not determined by him? And I
am glad, that on ſecond thoughts, you cannot find what may make it unlawful:
For, as you ſay, it would be intolerable in a Child or Servant, who when his
Parent or Maſter bids him do a thing lawful or indifferent, or elſe he
would beat him; ſhould reply, Sir, I could have done the thing if you had not
commanded it, but your Command renders it unlawful to me. I have ſaid ſo
much of this, which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count one of the moſt tremendous ſins in our
Conformity, as by your ſingling it out for the Subject of your Diſpute
which you managed at the <hi>Savoy</hi> with ſo much heat and importunity it
doth appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:65960:145"/>This concerning Kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is the third of thoſe ten Particulars which are mentioned by Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 131, 132, 133. and there he ſays that in their Exceptions
and Reply, we have an account of what they take to be unlawful and
inconvenient: 1. The Sign of the Croſs. 2. The Surplice. 3. Kneeling at the
Sacrament. 4. Pronouncing that Infants baptized are Regenerate. 5. Putting the
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Elements into the hands of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. 6. The Abſolution at the
Sacrament. 7. Giving thanks for all that are buried. 8. Subſcription to the
Book of Common Prayer. 9. Not permitted to uſe Extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Prayers. 10. The
Oath to the Biſhops. Theſe he judgeth contrary to the Word of
God.—But until Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or ſome other Nonformiſt, ſhall
confute the Arguments of the <hi>London</hi> Divines, and others that
aſſert the Lawfulneſs of theſe things, we have no reaſon to think of
Alterations.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of your writing to me, you ſay, is to crave
Satisfaction about two or three Matters of Fact in my Book.—One is in
theſe words, <hi>p.</hi> 101. <hi>When they had in the grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate given in
their Objections to the Liturgy, ſome of the Brotherhood had prepared another
Form; but a great part of their Brethren objected many things againſt that,
and never as yet did (as I hear of) agree upon any other, nor I think ever
will.</hi> And, as if I had not ſignified plainly enough that I meant the
grand Debate at the<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65960:145"/>
                  <hi>Savoy,</hi> you queſtion whether
I meant the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Aſſembly; when you your ſelf ſay
that it was the Directory which they drew up; and that none was yet vain enough
to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they drew up another Liturgy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was then very vain to
conjecture that I meant what was done by the <hi>Weſtminſter
Aſſembly;</hi> for, as he adds, it muſt needs be meant of the later, of
which this is paſt denial.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter. That the King's Commiſſion au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized us to
make ſome Additional Forms.</hi> (And adds what Archbiſhop <hi>Sheldon</hi>
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which concerns not me).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Inſtead of conforming to the King's
Commiſſion, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, that ſome of them drew up their
Exceptions againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, and appointed him to draw up Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Forms. <hi>But I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>drew up a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy which</hi> (the Prayer
for the King being made ſhorter by Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi>) <hi>was agreed to
without one diſſenting Vote.</hi> I am glad to hear that all the
Non-conforming Party did agree to a Liturgy, having ſo long acted according
to the Directory. And if they could agree to ſuch a Liturgy, as Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <hi>muſt be very imperfect, being done in
neceſſary haſte in eight days,</hi> I wonder that they could not be
reconciled to that Liturgy which was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely drawn up by our firſt
Reformers, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Biſhops, and Holy Martyrs, which had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured many a
Trial, and obtained the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65960:146"/>of the other parts of
the Reform'd Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and had been practiſed by many of thoſe that then
oppoſed it; and for their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was corrected in many things
whereat they took offence. Beſides, the King's Commiſſion authorized them
(if occaſion ſhould be) to make ſuch reaſonable and neceſſary
Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Corrections and Amendments, as ſhould be by both Parties agreed
to be needful to give Satisfaction to tender Conſciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But avoiding, as much as might be, all unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Alterations of Forms
and Liturgy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the People are already acquainted, and have ſo long
received in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And when Dr. <hi>Reignolds</hi>
thought they ſhould be blamed for offering a whole Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, inſtead of
Additional Forms, I thought I might rationally infer, that, as Dr.
<hi>Reignolds</hi> obſerved, they might juſtly be blamed for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
another Liturgy ſo directly oppoſite to the intention of the King's
Commiſſion. And I wonder how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> could ſay this work
<hi>(viz.)</hi> a new Liturgy, was extorted from them, when it was forbidden by
the King. Or how there was ſuch a full Concord, as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſpeaks of, when the Prayer for the King contained ſome things fit to be
omitted; and when Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> and others wrote, that there was no
neceſſity of Reforming the Church, either in Doctrine, Diſcipline, or
Worſhip; and when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays it muſt needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
imperfect? I confeſs that the diſſenting<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65960:146"/>Party might
agree to your Liturgy ſo, as to think it an imperfect haſty Work, free from
Hereſie, Blaſphemy, or Treaſon; but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Notion, as fit to
rival or thruſt out the Publick Liturgy; the Commiſſioners could not
agree on thoſe terms, ſeeing, as they obſerved, it left Men at liberty to
uſe it as a Directory, by ſaying <hi>thus,</hi> as in the ſeveral
Collects, or <hi>to this purpoſe,</hi> in a Prayer of their own conception;
for you tell them, <hi>it was not your work to impoſe;</hi> and what
unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Worſhip could be expected, if ſome ſhould uſe the Forms
in the Liturgy, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be left at liberty to uſe your Forms, or their
own Conceptions? Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended a Liturgy and Forms of Prayer,
to prevent the Inconveniencies which might be occaſioned by Extempory
Effuſions. And your Brethren in their <hi>Morning Lectures,</hi> affirm
<hi>p.</hi> 58. <hi>That the heart may be eaſily deceived in Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in
Prayer, Opinion of the Perſon, Taking Expreſſions, Popular Applauſe,
Flouriſhing No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties and Notions, Satanical Illuſions, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and
Ordinary Inſpirations, ſuch as are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Reprobates. All, or any of
which, may make the heart dance in a duty, and yet it's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, nay
probable, the heart may dance after the Devil's Pipe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Preface to your Liturgy, <hi>p.</hi> 23. you would have
your own Forms inſerted into the ſeveral places of the Liturgy to which
they do belong, and left to the Miniſters choice to<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65960:147"/>uſe the one or other. But firſt, this would ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate that
Grievance which you complain of, that the Liturgy is already too long. But
ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this would be to raiſe Altar againſt Altar, and maintain two
diſtinct Forms of Worſhip. And you doubted not but your correct
<hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penthes,</hi> as you term your Liturgy, would be better reliſhed by
young Prelates than a Doſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> to which you compare the
Liturgy; though a ſober uſe of <hi>Opium</hi> may be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to fix
the Spirits, which ſo large a draught of your <hi>Nepenthes</hi> may make
volatile and giddy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>I was eſpecially deſirous to have
heard their Exceptions againſt our Liturgy and urged ſome of them</hi>
(i.e.) the Biſhops, <hi>to it, and could never get a word of Anſwer or
Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> in his <hi>Relapſe
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi> ſays in the Introduction, <hi>That though your Liturgy was
addreſſed to the Biſhops, yet from them, above all the reſt, it was
with more care concealed—That it was delivered to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by
Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>or his order, and being wrought off, this</hi> Nepenthes
<hi>was barrelled up, and diſperſed through the Nation without the
knowledge of the Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing it had been delivered to them, it was not
their work to view or correct your Liturgy, but that which the King in his
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion recommended to them: it was their duty to reject yours in
groſs, without Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65960:147"/>on the Particulars. You add,
<hi>Nor had we one Objection from any other.</hi> Yet I ſaw a Treatiſe by a
very learned hand about that time, called, <hi>The grand Debate in caſe of
Prayer reſumed;</hi> proving that thoſe Free Pravers which you ſo
earneſtly contended for, had no advantage above the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Liturgy;
and by that Perſon, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Writers, there was not one Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made which was not anſwered and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I deſire therefore ſuch
Readers as do ſtill adhere to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Arguments againſt the
Common Prayer, to do themſelves ſo much right, as to peruſe what Dr.
<hi>Comber</hi> hath written concerning the Method obſerved in the ſeveral
parts of Devotion throughout the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, againſt the diſorder of it
objected by Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> and the ſeveral Caſes of the
<hi>London</hi> Divines againſt all Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, or any other
Objectors, concerning the Unlawfulneſs of any thing therein preſcribed. And
ſeeing in the Preface of his Majeſty's Commiſſion, he did expreſs his
Eſteem of the Liturgy, and authorized the Commiſſioners to make ſuch
reaſonable and neceſſary Alterations as by and between them ſhould be
agreed upon, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as might be all unneceſſary Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviations
of Form and Liturgy; not only the King had been diſobeyed, but the moſt
pious Members of the Church might juſtly be offended, if any of the
Commiſſioners ſhould have condeſcended to ſuch Alterations as were
inſiſted on, which would have amounted to<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65960:148"/>a
confeſſion that the Liturgy was a heavy burden to tender Conſciences, a
juſt cauſe of Schiſm, a Superſtitious Uſage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon
which pretences the Alterations were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>But firſt, It is not true that there was a full Concord as to
your Liturgy; for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obſerve, that the King's Commiſſion was
granted to about forty Perſons to review the Liturgy, and to make ſuch
reaſonable and neceſſary Alterations and Amendments, as by and between
the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhould be agreed upon to be needful and
expedient, avoiding as much as might be all unneceſſary Abbreviations of
the Form and Liturgy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the People are altogether acquainted, and have
ſo long received in the Ch. of <hi>England;</hi> can any Man believe there
was a full Concord (I will not ſay of all the Commiſſioners) to Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s new Liturgy, but among thoſe of the Diſſenters, that
there ſhould be a new Liturgy preſented, when the Commiſſion confined
them to make only ſome neceſſary Alterations and Amendments of the old,
expreſly cautioning them to avoid, as much as might be, all unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Abbreviations of the Form and Liturgy for the Reaſons therein alledged: For
though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> glorieth in this Exploit of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a new
Liturgy in eight days, yet he acknowledgeth it was very imperfect, and that Dr.
<hi>Reignolds</hi> ſaid they ſhould be blamed for it: and the Reaſon of
the thing, as well as<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65960:148"/>the Example of Dr.
<hi>Reignolds,</hi> was ſufficient to convince all ſuch as had any
ſenſe of their Duty, or hope of an Agreement. We find alſo (though Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> intimates the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) that there was a particular Exception
againſt the Prayer which he had made for the King, which was to be altered by
Dr. <hi>Wallis;</hi> his Rubrick alſo was diſliked by them, as he
confeſſeth. Beſides, it is certain that a great part of the
diſſenting Brethren had ſometime before conformed to the old Liturgy; not
only Dr. <hi>Reignolds</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf, but Dr.
<hi>Conant, Spurſtow, Wallis, Manton,</hi> and generally all the reſt; and
the Amendments and Alterations which were made, being about Six hundred, were
thought ſo reaſonable and ſatisfactory, that divers who had
diſſented, did conform to it, notwithſtanding that by reaſon of ſome
other Subſcriptions and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, their Conformity was made more
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, as did Dr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Conant,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> &amp;c. Where
then was this full Concord and no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions? when they all agreed to a
Liturgy; and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Model was a draught of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penthe,</hi>
compounded of unknown Ingredients, as every one ſhould fancy. And this I hope
may be a competent help to make Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> diſcern that the Report
that I made <hi>(viz.)</hi> that ſome of the Brotherhood had prepared another
Form; but ſome of them objected many things againſt that, and never as yet
(that I<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65960:149"/>heard) did agree upon any other, and I think never
will, is a true Report, and ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Miniſter of Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>But I well know it is a part of Satan's
work to perſwade the World that no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory hath any certainty of Truth,
that ſo Sacred Hiſtory may be diſadvantaged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be Satan's work falſly to relate
Matters of Fact recorded in Hiſtory; and if it tends to ſo impious a
Deſign as to diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Credit of Sacred Hiſtory; I doubt not to
make it appear in two inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> in that Hiſtorical Relation
which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath given concerning Biſhops, and in that of the
beginning of our deteſtible Civil War, of which I ſhall take occaſion to
ſpeak, on two Aſſertions of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this Letter; the one
is where he affirms, <hi>That of all things that ever befel the Chriſtian
Church, he ſcarce knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing comparable in ſhame and miſchievous
effects, to the horrid Perfidiouſneſs, Contention, Schiſm and Pride of
Biſhops.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>That it was an Epiſcopal Parliament
(forty or an hundred to one) that began the War againſt the King.</hi> On
theſe two Aſſertions of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> I ſay, I ſhall make it
evident, that none hath done more to diſadvantage the credit of Sacred
Hiſtory than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath done in the falſe Relation of other
Hiſtories, be a ready way to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Another paſſage is</hi> p. 293.
(which being imperfectly related by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I ſhall 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65960:149"/>give it the Reader in full) <hi>viz. (Miniſterial
Conformity being ſubmitted to by many of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines, and no
ſinful act required to make it unlawful, which if there had been, they, or
ſome others, ought to have diſcovered it, and then I doubt not, it would by
Authority have been taken away; but that being not done) the Miniſters ought
to conform by the ſame Rules as the People ought; which is granted by
Propoſition the fourth, and confirmed by Mr.</hi> Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<hi>'s practice in
receiving the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> repeats only ſo much as
is within the Parentheſis, on which he runs out into ſix grand Diviſions,
and under them into two, or three, and ſo under one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to five
Sub-diviſions: The whole may be comprehended in theſe two; 1. That the
Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Conformity hath been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And then 2dly, That we
require im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities of them, becauſe they have not the liberty of
the Preſs. [Though the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pulpit be as much denied them, yet it
is no impoſſibility to uſe that.] But I ſhall for the Reader's
ſatisfaction conſider the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Do you not know what abundance of old
have thought they diſcovered the ſinfulneſs of Conformity,</hi>
(Bradſhaw, Nicols, Ames, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Cartwright, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>and
ſome of late againſt our Conformity,</hi> Cawdry, Hickman, <hi>and others,
yet unanſwered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know what the moſt of thoſe you 
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65960:150"/>name have written. And I know that what you ſay they
thought to be ſins, have by <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift, Bancroft, Hooker, Moreton,
Burgeſs</hi> and <hi>Sprint</hi> been proved to be the Non-conformiſts
duties. And as to the new Conformity, it hath by theſe Doctors, <hi>Faukner,
Durel, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> proved to be lawful; and alſo by the Lay-Conformity of
all the old Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, as well as by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to be
lawful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>And is this your dry Denial a rational
Confutation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Confutation! of what? No ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Man would
undertake a Confutation, of what others only thought, (and <hi>Idem eſt non
eſſe &amp; non apparere,</hi>) had the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment acted rationally
when they armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they had no other Enemy to fight againſt,
but thoſe falſe Reports of German Troops and Armies under ground, and
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to blow up the <hi>Thames,</hi> which were ſometime talked off?
This were like <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> to fight with Windmils and Fancies of their
own inventions; bring down your Objections from the Clouds, fix them
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where that we may behold them, and try if they be formidable
<hi>Gorgons,</hi> as can at ſight transform the Conformiſts into ſuch
heinous Sinners, a dry Denial is enough to confute the Man in the Moon. I will
not ſay as you did concerning the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I would
give all the Money in my Purſe to know what it is; but, as <hi>Caeſar</hi>
ſaid of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65960:150"/>
                  <hi>Britains,</hi> who dwelt in
Woods and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, That it is leſs difficult to overcome them than
to find them out; and when they ſhall appear, I have ſo much confidence in
the good Nature of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that I may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Weapons enough out
of his Magazine to turn them all into Duſt; though he thinks that it is no
ſmall number of ſins ſo heinous, that are impoſed by Conformity, that
he dares not ſo much as name them, leſt he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe and
render the Conformiſts ſuch hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinners. And <hi>p.</hi> 31. of
<hi>Sacr. Deſertion, That (Conformity) is a compoſition of ſuch hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Crimes as I forbear to name, for fear of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be an Accuſer of
others, and to be unpeacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> This is as if he had told his Superiours
to their Faces, That they were a company of ungodly Perſons and cruel
Perſecutors, that their Sins were great for number, and heinous in their
nature. But I will not name any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for fear of Diſpleaſing, or
being thought your Accuſer and Unpeaceable.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a caſe I think it not unreaſonable if the
Superiours had told Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that he ought to do it. But Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> will excuſe himſelf thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>That Men ought not to be blamed for not
doing Impoſſibilities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the thing were impoſſible to be done, it
is very blameable to pretend or attempt the doing of it. But wherein lyeth the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility? 1. You ſay, <hi>The Law forbids it.</hi> 
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:65960:151"/>2. You are <hi>ipſo facto Excommunicate.</hi> 3.
<hi>Your Governours are againſt it.</hi> 4. <hi>It would drive you to Jails
and Ruine?</hi> 5. <hi>We have begg'd leave of Parliament Men to publiſh the
Caſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your diſſent.</hi> But, good Sir, is not your
preaching in Conventicles forbidden by the ſame Law under the like Penalties?
and yet thoſe tearing Engines, as you call them, do not make you forbear
printing or preaching; nor do you want the liberty of the Preſs for
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging Seditious Pamphlets, and railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Biſhops and
Conformity. The impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility therefore doth not lye in theſe External
Circumſtances, but in the nature of the thing. There is no ſinfulneſs in
what is required in Conformity, and therefore it is impoſſible for you to
ſhew it. You tell us indeed that you have by your writing diſcovered the
ſinfulneſs of the old Conformity, and refer us to your publick Reply and
Petition againſt it; and that ſome Pamphlets, ſuch as <hi>Cawdrys,
Hickmans,</hi> &amp;c. have crept out: but you confeſs nothing that is full
and ſatisfactory, no not in any of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Writings; though he
talks in general, That in our Liturgy there are ſome things that ſeem to be
corrupt, and carry a repugnancy to the Rule of the Goſpel, <hi>p.</hi> 11. of
his <hi>Savoy</hi> Papers, where he ſpends 148 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Exceptions againſt
the Liturgy; which the Biſhops anſwer in theſe few words, <hi>p.</hi> 45.
<hi>The Church hath been careful to put nothing into the Liturgy but what is
evidently the Word of<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65960:151"/>God, or hath been generally received
in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and if the contrary can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we wiſh it out
of the Liturgy.</hi> And this may anſwer that Enquiry of</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Which way got you ſo ſtrong a
faith, as to be paſt doubt, that did we diſcover any ſinfulneſs, it
would by Authority be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Make this true, and you ſhall have the
honour of being the greateſt healer of our breaches that ever roſe in the
days of my remembrance. But if this be not true—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſtrength of my Faith is built on the
ground of my Charity, which teacheth me to hope and believe all good things of
my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, eſpecially until I am aſſured of the contrary, and when
they have made ſuch good Laws, in Church and State, as many thouſands of
good Chriſtians of tender Conſciences, do ſubmit to, and they
themſelves devoutly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. I cannot think they would eſtabliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
known iniquity by Law, after their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion which you have ſeen under
their own hands; that if there were any ſuch thing could be proved, as they
had reaſon and judgment to diſcern it, ſo it was in their power to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the amendment, and they wiſhed it out. So that whatever your Faith
be to believe there are ſuch heinous ſins in Conformity, I hope my Charity
is agreeable to the Chriſtian Faith, that if any ſuch thing had appeared,
it would have been taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>But I ſhall alledge your Authority 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65960:152"/>when we are blamed for diſcovering the ſinfulneſs
of Conformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have a greater Authority than mine, the Law
of God; <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Brother,
and not ſuffer ſin to be upon him.</hi> And of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph.
5.11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but
rather reprove them.</hi> Therefore, I ſay again, you ought to have done it,
and to be plain, I ſee no reaſon why you have not done it, but becauſe it
is impoſſible to be done; you find all the Cavils which you have yet uſed
to be inſufficient, and would ſeem to reſerve more cogent ones to keep up
the Courage of your Party, and amuze their Conſciences with Noiſe and
Clamour, Fears and Jealouſies, and ſo perpetuate the Schiſm. I cannot
paſs by one odious Reflection on our Governours, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>That near Two thouſand Miniſters
have been near ſixteen Years ejected and ſilenced, and many years
impriſoned and killed, and the People of the Land divided and diſtracted by
the tearing Engines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such Language ill becomes Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
who, notwithſtanding many Provocations, hath taſted ſo much of the
Clemency of our Governours. Had you lived in the <hi>Marian</hi> days under
<hi>Bonner,</hi> you durſt not have ſaid ſo much. But who were thoſe
Two thouſand? In your Letter to Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> you ſpeak but of
about Eighteen hundred, and you are not wont to mince the matter: A great
number of<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65960:152"/>them had poſſeſſed themſelves of other
Mens Rights, and it was an Act of Juſtice to reſtore the Owners to their
Rights. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I hear, was he that invaded
<hi>Kidderminſter,</hi> the Property of one Mr. <hi>Dance,</hi> whom he
confeſt to be a Man of an unblameable Life; but not thought fit for ſo
great a Congregation, much more to have any Reſtitution made for all that was
taken from him. As for thoſe that had lawful Titles, ſome of them were
altogether unqualified, as to Learning or good Lives; the reſt ejected
themſelves for not obeying the Laws. There were no tearing Engines made uſe
of. The lawleſs Practiſes of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, under the Long Parliament,
deſerved that name: whenas Mr. <hi>White</hi> their Centuriſt writes,
<hi>There were about Eighteen thouſand Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, all lawful Miniſters,
illegally ejected, both <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities deprived of their Scholars, who were
driven to great Neceſſities, not ſuffered to teach Schools, no not in a
Gentleman's Houſe for the Education of their Children, twelve Biſhops clapt
into the</hi> Tower <hi>at once, the reſt Sequeſtred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any
Proviſion or Reſpect to their Age, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Piety.</hi> And I need not
prove it to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who knows the truth of what I ſay, That that
one Engine of the Scottiſh Covenant deſtroyed more in one year, both Laity
and Clergy, than all the tearing Engines did ever ſince they were formed into
Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>The third paſſage is</hi> p. 69,
70. which though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath not, I ſhall here 
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65960:153"/>tranſcribe, and it may ſerve to Anſwer Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s Queſtion; <hi>Can you name,</hi> ſays he, <hi>one
Presbyter for very many Biſhops, that have been the Heads or Fomenters of
Hereſie, Schiſm or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? and that (for his part) he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
comparable in ſhame and miſchievous effects to the horrid
Perſidiouſneſs, Contention, Schiſm, and Pride of Biſhops.</hi> In
oppoſition to this I ſaid in the place quoted, <hi>That</hi> Novatus
<hi>and</hi> Novatian, Aerius <hi>and</hi> Arius, Donatus <hi>and his Fellow
Presbyters, who aſſumed the Epiſcopal Power to themſelves, had ſhed
more Blood and committed more Outrages than were done under any inſtance of
Epiſcopal Ambition; and that our late Schiſm at home, and the Wounds made
by it are yet ſo open, that there needs no Rhetorick but our own Experience
to teach us, that the little Finger of the Presbyterians is heavier than the
Epiſcopal Loyns.</hi> Let any Man ſum up together the Miſchiefs
occaſioned by the Avarice and Ambition of Biſhops for One hundred Years
together in this our Nation, and I dare ingage to demonſtrate that for
Wickedneſs in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for Malice and Cruelty in Executing, for Pride and
Arrogance in Uſurping, in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and Implacableneſs in endeavouring
to perpetuate unparallel'd Confuſions. Though ſome Biſhops had done
amiſs, yet our Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians have exceeded them all: For let me be
informed, Whether for a <hi>Juncto</hi> of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, who had often ſworn
Fidelity to their Prince, and Obedience to their lawful Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65960:153"/>to abrogate theſe Sacred Obligations, and by dethroning
one incomparable Prince, to ſet up many Tyrants, and by covenanting againſt
one Biſhop in a Dioceſs, to erect Two or Three hundred, and expoſe all
the Clergy, that would not partake with them in their ſins, to contempt and
miſery, be not an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Miſchief; Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> himſelf, whom
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo magnifies for his Book of Schiſm, found their tender
Mercies to be cruel, whom they deprived of that plentiful Eſtate which he
enjoyed under the Epiſcopal Government, being reduced to that Extremity, that
he was forced to ſell his Books to ſupply his Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Let me be
informed, I pray you, whether this be not more than any Biſhop did, or could
be guilty of? Such Indignities, Perjuries, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations and Cruelties as
theſe Men have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt their juſt, lawful, and excellent
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in Church and State, I believe have not been acted ſince
<hi>Judas</hi> betrayed his Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Theſe are great things to be ſpoken
ſo boldly,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And they were bolder Men that acted them, ſay
I. But I am at a loſs what to ſay of them who were the firſt
Incendiaries, the Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefews, that blew up the Coals, and ſcattered ſuch
Wild-fire through the Nation, as ran through every City, Town, and Village in
the Nation; let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeak his own thoughts of ſuch: They
may juſtly fear of being Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands in Hell, for their being Fire-brands on
Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:65960:154"/>The paſſage which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
thought not fit to recite, led me to conſider what Miſchief had been
occaſioned by the Ambition of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Presbyters; ſuch as
<hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Aerius</hi> and <hi>Arius, Donatus</hi> and
his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of old, and by a <hi>Juncto</hi> of Presbyterians in our own
days: and he confeſſeth that <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Aerius</hi> were not
Biſhops; and he might have ſaid it of <hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Novatian,
Donatus</hi> and his Fellows, that they were not Biſhops, but ſeekers of
Biſhopricks, and divided becauſe they could not obtain them.
<hi>Surely,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter, they were Prelatical Presbyters:</hi>
And concludes thus, <hi>I will never, while I breathe, truſt a Presbyter that
ſets himſelf to get Preferment, no more than I will truſt a</hi>—he
might have ſaid, as King <hi>James</hi> did a Highland or Border Robber.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but the Reader will obſerve with me what a pitiful
ſhift Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was put to, when he ſays, <hi>That if</hi> Arius
<hi>or</hi> Novatus, Aerius <hi>and</hi> Donatus, (<hi>which,</hi> he ſays,
<hi>are all the Presbyters that I name,</hi> though I had named
<hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Novatian,</hi> and could have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned many more, if
an Anſwer to a Letter would have permitted it) <hi>were the beginners of any
Schiſm, many hundred Biſhops were the promoters of them all;</hi> which is
as much as if he had ſaid, That when theſe Presbyters had ſupplanted
their Biſhops, and aſſumed both the Name and Authority of Biſhops to
themſelves, then thoſe Biſhops and their Succeſſors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and
formented the Schiſms and Hereſies<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65960:154"/>which the firſt
Inventers had broached againſt thoſe Orthodox and Legal Biſhops with all
manner of violence and cruelty. And this is that fallacy that runs through Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s whole Hiſtory of Epiſcopacy, wherein all the Tumults and
Confuſions, which the Off-ſpring of thoſe ambitious Presbyters had acted,
is by him imputed to Biſhops. Whereas in truth they were not otherwiſe
Biſhops than of their own making; and having uſurped that title, did with
force and bloodſhed defend their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Schiſms and Hereſies, to the
great mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and diſturbance of the true Biſhops. I ſhall make
this appear in what was tranſacted here at home: Thus we had an order of
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and Learned Biſhops as ever was in the Church from the Reformation,
but were always maligned by the Presbyters: In the Year 1640. this malignity
vented it ſelf. Concerning other Particulars, as that of the <hi>Tria
Capitula</hi> and <hi>Philippicus,</hi> mentioned by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> under
this Head, I refer the Reader to the former Treatiſe for an anſwer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Smectymnians</hi> write ſcurrilous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
againſt them; the <hi>London</hi> Rabble are ſtirred up to Petition
againſt them; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf having in <hi>Anno</hi> 1640.
conceived a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of them, began to write his <hi>Hiſtory of
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> to repreſent them as the Lords of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule; twelve
Biſhops are ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Archbiſhop beheaded, the
reſt-ſequeſtred, the Nation drawn into a Covenant againſt them, 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65960:155"/>their Revenues imployed to maintain a War againſt the
King, and to gratifie ſuch Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as had defamed and oppoſed them.
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe grew up the ſeveral Factions of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Anabaptiſts,
Quakers, and a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Army that ſet the whole Nation into a Flame, that
continued to devour for 20 years together. Now ſuppoſe the Supream Power
<hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Parliament, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, had advanced
ſome of the moſt active Presbyters, as Superintendents, or Biſhops and
Archbiſhops, for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> approves of this laſt Order as
Overſeers of Biſhops; would it become a true Hiſtorian to impute all the
Diſorders and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions that were acted by and under the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Factions and thus made Biſhops, to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which were depoſed,
preſcribed, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into Corners, or expoſed to innumerable Affronts
and Sufferings during all that time, and yet this is the manner of Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi>'s deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe more ancient Biſhops which he
mentioneth (as a true Hiſtorian) throughout his <hi>Hiſtory of
Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Did you know or not that</hi> Novatus
<hi>was an ill choſen Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>a
promoter of his Prelacy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knew that
<hi>Novatus</hi> was meerly a Presbyter, and that in his time
<hi>Cornelius</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with whom <hi>Novatus</hi>
had a quarrel for admitting ſuch to his Communion, as in the days of
Perſecution under <hi>Decius,</hi> had denied the<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65960:155"/>Faith,
<hi>Novatus</hi> affirming, That they could not repent after their Fall; and
hereupon he calls his <hi>Faction</hi> the <hi>Cathari.</hi> This pure
Presbyter being at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſe ſends for three Ruſtick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
(as my Author calls them) to come to him from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>
where he careſſeth them with plenty of good Victuals and Wine, and when
they had well drank, ſome of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus</hi> his Party prevail with thoſe
Biſhops to lay their hands on <hi>Novatus,</hi> and make him a Biſhop; but
whether a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, I have not
read; but that <hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Novatian,</hi> who eſpouſed his
Opinion, and promoted his Faction, to the great diſturbance of
<hi>Cornelius</hi> the lawful Biſhop, is notorious in Eccleſiaſtical
Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>As for</hi> Donatus, <hi>there were two
of them, one of them a Biſhop; and the</hi> Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt <hi>Schiſm was
meerly and baſely Prelatical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here I queſtion your Fidelity; and have
proved at large in my <hi>Hiſtory of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> that the Schiſm
was wholly Presbyterial: for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Carthage</hi> being void,
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus</hi> and <hi>Celeſius,</hi> two Presbyters, ſought to
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant <hi>Cecilian,</hi> a Perſon of known Integrity, who was choſen
Biſhop of that Church: But <hi>Lucilla,</hi> a Woman deſcended from a Noble
Family of <hi>Spain;</hi> abets their quarrel, and by great Gifts prevail with
<hi>Botrus</hi> and <hi>Celeſius,</hi> who had been defeated, to appear for
<hi>Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who was Domeſtick Chaplain to <hi>Lucilla,</hi> and had
been Deacon to <hi>Cecilian:</hi> theſe gather<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65960:156"/>a great
number of perſons, whom they had drawn from the Communion of
<hi>Cecilian,</hi> to meet at <hi>Cirta,</hi> where they pronounce
<hi>Cecilian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as a Traditor, and ſet up <hi>Majorinus</hi> to
be Bp. of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who dying ſhortly after, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> is by
his Party choſen to ſucceed him; whom <hi>Cecilian</hi> accuſed for
re-baptizing thoſe that came to his Party from the Catholick Church, and for
degrading Biſhops and Prieſts. And this was the riſe of the Sect of the
Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, under whom the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie ſpread it ſelf, and
the Crew of <hi>Circumcellians</hi> aroſe, as may be ſeen at large in the
<hi>Hiſtory of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts.</hi> This is a ſecond Inſtance of the
Schiſm begun by Presbyters, and of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in
relating Church Hiſtory, and imputing the Troubles cauſed and continued by
Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The third inſtance is <hi>Arius</hi> a Presbyter of
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was bred up under <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus</hi>
another Presbyter, from whom <hi>Arius</hi> was taught, <hi>That Chriſt was
not the Eternal Son of God, but meer Man from both his Parents.</hi> This
<hi>Meletius</hi> held it lawful in times of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>to deny
Chriſt,</hi> as he had done; and pleaded, <hi>That he had not denied God, but
Man.</hi> For theſe Tenets <hi>Peter</hi> Bp. of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them both; but <hi>Peter</hi> dying, <hi>Achillus</hi>
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, under whom <hi>Arius</hi> reading Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> began to publiſh his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and infected great
numbers, inſomuch that <hi>Achillus</hi> dying, he became Competitor for 
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65960:156"/>that Biſhoprick with <hi>Alexander,</hi> who being a
Perſon of known Abilities and Integrity, was choſen by a general Suffrage
of that Church, by this good Biſhop. <hi>Arius</hi> was Excommunicated for
oppoſing the Divinity of Chriſt, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that he was not from
Eternity, nor did partake of the Subſtance of the Father, being created in
time, and was indeed more excellent than other Creatures, but not equal with
the Father.</hi> He chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to diſpute theſe his heretical Opinions
with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and a time and place was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; but as
<hi>Arius</hi> was come to the place, an extream pain in his Bowels ſeiz'd on
him, and going aſide to eaſe himſelf, his very Bowels fell from him. But
his Name and Hereſie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in another <hi>Arius,</hi> or (as Hiſtory
ſtiles him, <hi>Arianus homo potius quam Arius</hi>) who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> but upon a full
diſcuſſion of the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrines by that Council, his Hereſie
was condemned, the Books written for it were burnt, and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſet forth
by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> threatning Death to ſuch as ſhould conceal any
of their Books. Now how long this Hereſie prevailed, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Catholick
Biſhops were baniſht and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered for oppoſing it; how it ſpread like
a <hi>Gangreen</hi> through all the Members of the Church, as you have ſet
forth in your <hi>Hiſtory of Biſhops,</hi> is moſtly true; but your
imputing thoſe Confuſions to the Catholick Biſhops, who were the
Sufferers in all that time, being the defenſive Party, I am bold to ſay is
falſe:<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65960:157"/>for under the <hi>Arian</hi> Schiſm, and by
ſuch as took part with them, as the <hi>Donatiſts, Neſtorians,
Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians, Macedonians, Acephalites, Monothelites,</hi> who often made havock
of one another, and all united to diſtreſs the true Biſhops; all thoſe
Miſchiefs which you mention in this Letter, and more largely in your
<hi>Hiſt. of Biſhops,</hi> were put in Execution for 140 years together,
<hi>(i.e.)</hi> from the days of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to the days of
<hi>Conſtantius—nec dum finitus Oreſtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Were it not for entering on an
unpleaſing and unprofitable task, I would ask you, Who that</hi> Juncto
<hi>of Presbyters was that dethroned the King?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were ſuch as the <hi>Weſtminſter
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,</hi> that diſperſed their Members into the Country to
animate the People to ingage in the War againſt the King, and with Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> aſſiſted in carrying on the War from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to
the end, and drew many thouſands to ingage in that War. Thoſe that
incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Rabble of <hi>London</hi> to go to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and demand Juſtice of him, in ſuch Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, as forced him to leave his
Palace for fear of loſing his Life: Thoſe that ſeiz'd his Towns, Forts,
Magazines, and Ships to maintain the War againſt him: Thoſe that animated
Armies, with whom he was often preſent in Perſon, till they forced him to
fly to the <hi>Scots:</hi> Thoſe that ſold and bought him as a Priſoner
of War, and voted no more Addreſſes to him, but left him to ſuch as at

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The King was dethron'd long before any
Presbyterians petitioned or proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt putting him to death: then
indeed, when it was too late, the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> plead for him
in theſe words; <hi>That the woful Miſcarriages of the King himſelf,
which we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be very many and great in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have coſt the three Kingdoms ſo dear, and caſt him down from his
Excellency into a horrid pit of Miſery beyond Example;</hi> this is as one
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſeth it: <hi>We affirm and teſtifie, that beſides thoſe of his
evil Counſellors, the King's Perſonal Crimes and fundamental Errors in
Government, too many and great to be mentioned, have coſt</hi> England,
Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>ſo dear, that all the bloodſhed,
devaſtations, and rapine might be charged on him, and for theſe he is
juſtly caſt down from his Throne into ſo horrid a Pit of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, as to
fall under a Sentence of Condemnation.</hi> This is ſuch a Petition and Plea
for the King, as thoſe that are made for Peace, which are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for
Separation and Diſcord. Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> a great Presbyterian, in his
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi> Sermon, laid a Foundation of this in that Maxim, <hi>Melius
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reat unus quam unitas.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> exceeds all, in
repreſenting him as the Head of the <hi>Grotian</hi> Religion, which he
ſays were <hi>arrant Papiſts:</hi> This is ſuch a Slander as his
barbarous Judges were aſhamed to charge him with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Was it not an Epiſcopal Parliament, 
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65960:158"/>forty or one hundred to one, that began the War againſt
the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were indeed Epiſcopal Men and
Conformiſts for the moſt part at their firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but there was a
<hi>Juncto</hi> among them that ſoon prevailed to ſilence and baniſh the
Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Members, and then openly declared War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, and ruin to
the Biſhops. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was one of thoſe Epiſcopal conforming
Men; but what he did hath been related: and he well knew of what Perſwaſion
the five Members were, and thoſe whom he Canonizeth as Saints in his
<hi>Everlaſting Reſt:</hi> Theſe had ſometime been zealous
Conformiſts, and the King's moſt Loyal Subjects; but did they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſuch? The Biſhops that began the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation had been Popiſh, but when
they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Pope's Supremacy and Romiſh Doctrines, and ſetled the
Church on a new Foundation for Doctrine and Worſhip, no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Man can
ſay that the Reformation was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begun or carried on by Popiſh
Biſhops. The Caſe is the ſame: Thoſe that began our war had been moſt
of them Epiſcopal Men and Conformiſts; but when they impriſon'd and
ſequeſtred the Biſhops, threw off the Liturgy, and entred into a Covenant
againſt King and Church, they were neither Epiſcopal Men nor Conformiſts.
Of this ſort were the Generals, Admirals, and other Officers by Land and
Sea,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Whether the Archbiſhop of</hi> York

ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in any Hoſtile Actions till 6 years after the beginning of the War;

not on account of the war againſt the King, as hath been proved in that
Biſhop's Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter. <hi>Whether the Epiſcopal Gentry and

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I pray Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> remember what you
were to prove <hi>(viz.)</hi> who began the War; and and is this which was done
after the King's death (if it had been true) an Argument to prove that they
began the War. I have read in ſeveral of your Books ſuch a Relation of the
beginning of our War, which will remain after you are gone; <hi>That the War
was begun by Epiſcopal Men,</hi> ſuch as were of Archbiſhop
<hi>Whitgift</hi>'s mind; <hi>That the great Commanders in War by Sea and Land,
were Conformiſts;</hi> and I ſuppoſe I have ſaid enough to diſprove
it: Let me therefore remind you of a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going paſſage in your Letter,
<hi>viz. That it is a part of Satan's work to perſwade the World, that no
Hiſtory hath any certainty of Truth, that ſo Sacred Hiſtory may be
diſadvantaged;</hi> and now let the impartial Reader judge, whether
<hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be the trueſt Hiſtorian. I
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65960:159"/>you have ingaged me in an unpleaſing Work;
but in may not be unprofitable, if what I ſhall add be duly conſidered: Let
the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at <hi>Frankfort</hi> be read over, and the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Conteſts and Animoſities of ſome Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians againſt ſuch as
adhered to the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> while
both Parties were in Exile, and what you your ſelf have obſerved of their
behaviour after they returned home, eſpecially of <hi>Knox, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and others, how they flew in the face of Authority, and inceſſantly woried
Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> during her Reign? No ſooner were they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led home, but
ſome of them were ſo intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, impatient, and unpeaceable, that ſome
of them turned to flat Separation, and flew in the Faces of the Prelates with
reviling, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 150. of <hi>Gildas Salvianus.</hi> And if the
Hiſtory of the Factious for Presbytery, during the Reign of King
<hi>James,</hi> and eſpecially of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. be impartially
read, you will find this odious Compariſon incomparably out-done. This is
proper to them, to overthrow whatſoever E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate they are admitted to,
(ſays <hi>Bertius, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Breviario.</hi>) And this is the reaſon why
<hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was ſo condemned for a Papiſt, becauſe in his Book
<hi>de Antichriſto,</hi> he wrote ſo much truth againſt theſe Men,
<hi>Circumferamus oculos per om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem hiſtoriam; quod unquam ſeculum, vidit
tot ſubditorum in Principes bella, ſub religionis ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulo, &amp; horum

Donum Regium, videbit eum, ut erat magni Judicij, ea praedixiſſe, quae nunc
cum dolore &amp; horrore perſpicimus.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> ſpake by
Experience; and firſt he tells the Reader in his Preface, <hi>Theſe raſh
heady Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers think it their honour to contend with Kings, and perturbe
whole Kingdoms.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 41, 42. <hi>Take heed my Son to ſuch
Puritans, very Peſts in the Church and Commonweal; whom no Deſerts can
oblige, neither Oaths or Promiſes bind; breathing nothing but Sedition and
Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, aſpiring without meaſure, railing without reaſon, and making
their own imaginations, without any warrant of the Word, the ſquare of their
Conſcience. I protest before the great God, and ſince I am here, as upon my
Teſtament, it is no place for me to lye in, that ye ſhall never find, with
any Highland or Border Thieves, greater ingratitude, and more lyes and vile
perjuries, than with theſe Phanatick Spirits. And ſuffer not the Principles
of them to brook your Land, if you like to ſit at rest; except you would keep
them for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your patience, as</hi> Socrates <hi>did an evil Wife.</hi> He
told his Parliament, in his Speech <hi>March</hi> 19. 1603. <hi>The third which
I call a Sect rather than Religion, is the Puritan and Noveliſt, who do not
differ ſo much from us in points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in their confuſed Forms
of Polity and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65960:160"/>being ever diſcontented with the
preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and impatient to ſuffer any Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which maketh
their Sect unable to be ſuffered in any well-governed Commonwealth.</hi> And
now you may reſearch your voluminous <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius,</hi>
and collect the Maxims and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Jeſuits, who are not much elder
than the Presbyterians, and if I do not match them in both from the Authors
before-named; all which will not make up above one Volume of your twenty, and
relate only the Hiſtory of about ſix or ſevenſcore years, for yours of
about ſixteen hundred. I ſhall need to add only your own Theſes
concerning Government, and what I ſaid will ſtill appear to be true,
<hi>That ſuch horrid things as have been done by that Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have not
been out-done by any other ſince</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das <hi>betrayed his Maſter.</hi>
By theſe Relations Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may be inform'd, That ſomething hath
befal'n the Church that for ſhame and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous effects, hath exceeded
the Perſidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Contention, Schiſm, and Pride of Biſhops.</p>
